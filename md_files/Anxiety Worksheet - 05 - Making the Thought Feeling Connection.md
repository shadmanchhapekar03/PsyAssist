Part One

**SCENARIO 1:**


You’ve had a rather long and tiring day at work where you were helping a colleague move boxes of
stationery and office equipment. You arrive home to find the front door ajar and two sets of muddy
footprints (your son’s and his dog’s) on your cream-coloured carpet leading from the front door all the
way to the back door.



**A) You say to yourself:**


“What! N@!^#*M!! I’ve had such a tiring day at work and
now I come home to this!?!! What have I done to deserve
this! We just had the carpet cleaned last week! That naughty
boy! All he cares about is himself! That inconsiderate, selfish
brat! I’m gonna ground him for 2 years!!!”


**B) You say to yourself:**


“I’ve told him a thousand times not to bring the dog into the
house and he never listens to me. My kids don’t obey even
the simplest instructions. I must be the worst mother in the
world. If I can’t even get this right, I must be a terrible
failure.”


**SCENARIO 2:**



**Possible Feelings:**


**Possible Feelings:**



One evening, your parents ask you to go over to their house for dinner. As you arrive, you noticed that
it was all dark and there were no lights on. You knock on the door and ring the doorbell but no one
comes to answer the door. You turn the doorknob and find that the door is unlocked. You step in and
find that the house is in total darkness. Suddenly, you hear a chorus of voices shouting, “Surprise!” The
lights come on and you see a group of your friends and relatives singing “Happy Birthday” to you.



**You say to yourself:**


“Wow! I didn’t even remember that it was my birthday!
What a really nice surprise! Hey, even uncle James and aunt
Bertha came and they live in the country! Everyone must
think I’m pretty important to throw me this party!
