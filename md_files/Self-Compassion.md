### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~
#### **Introduction**

The old saying goes that, _“You are your own worst critic”_ . It is very true that most of us are hard on
ourselves, particularly if we get even the slightest hint that we don’t ‘match up’ in some way – in our
achievements, career or study, social standing, relationships, appearance, body image, financial status, etc. If
we make even the minutest mistake, then we have a tendency to berate ourselves, and if we make a
genuine medium or large mistake, then look out!

People seem to find it hard, and for some almost impossible, to treat or speak to themselves in a kind or
caring manner. In fact, some recoil from the idea of it, like they were being asked to do something
repulsive or painful. In this module we will look at what self-compassion is all about, why it is so vital to
our well-being, and why we are great at self-criticism, but struggle when it comes to self-kindness.

Being able to cultivate self-compassion can be a stand-alone approach that might
address all your mental health needs, or it may be a helpful starting point to then go
on and address more specific issues that are covered in our other Infopax. Either
way, if you identify with being your own harshest critic, then join us on the journey
from self-criticism to self-kindness…


#### **What is Self-Compassion?**

To define _self-compassion_, we really need to start with what is _compassion_ . The two are really one and the
same. Compassion is an attitude that involves a certain set of feelings, thoughts, motives, desires, urges,
and behaviours that can be directed towards any living thing (i.e., ourselves, another person, a group of
people, a society, animals, the environment, etc.). Therefore, when we talk about self-compassion, we are
specifying that this attitude is being directed internally towards ourselves.

Paul Gilbert and Kristen Neff are two leading figures in the area of building self-compassion to improve
mental health and well-being, and these modules draw heavily on their expertise and writing.

Kristen Neff defines compassion as:



_“the recognition and clear seeing of suffering…feelings of kindness for people who are suffering, so that the_
_desire to help – to ameliorate suffering – emerges… recognizing our shared human condition, flawed and_
_fragile as it is”_ (Neff, 2011, p10)

Similarly, Paul Gilbert defines compassion as:

_“a basic kindness, with a deep awareness of the suffering of oneself and of other living things, coupled with_
_the wish and effort to relieve it”_ (Gilbert, 2009, p. xiii)

You will notice that these definitions emphasise four key things:



1. **Awareness.** Being attentive or sensitive to the fact that some sort of ‘suffering’ is occurring. Now
suffering could mean some distressing struggle with emotional pain, mental pain, physical pain, or all
of the above.

2. **Normalising.** Recognising that experiencing this sort of pain is universal, we all experience pain at
some point to varying degrees. The fact that we experience pain isn’t a fault or failing of ours, we
are not to blame for our pain, and we are not alone in our pain.

3. **Kindness.** Not shying away from or ignoring the pain, but meeting this pain with feelings of
kindness, care, warmth and concern.

4. **Alleviation.** Focusing our energy on ways to alleviate the pain, which may be via providing further
comfort and caring actions, providing a helpful perspective regarding whatever the trouble is, or
having the strength and courage to take other necessary actions to address the problem being
faced.

### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~

So self-compassion is about doing all of these four things for ourselves when we are struggling. That is,
being aware of our own pain, whatever that may be. Understanding that whilst feeling this pain is hard, this
is a normal human experience, not a failing on our part and we are not alone. It then involves directing
feelings of kindness and care towards ourselves, just as we might to someone else we care about who is
struggling. And finally, focusing our attention and energy on how we might improve our own pain and
move through the struggle we are facing.

You may think, well that all sounds very nice, but how exactly do I do that? The modules to come will help
you develop the ability to take a deeply caring attitude towards yourself, particularly in times of struggle.
Being self-compassionate is a skill that initially takes a lot of effort, so before we get to the ‘nuts and bolts’
of how to be more self-compassionate, let’s first think about why it would be worth the effort.

#### **Why is Self-Compassion Important?**


**Evolutionary Importance**
The need to receive care and nurturing evolved as a strong need within all mammals, including humans.
Being cared for from birth is vital to our survival, and without it we don’t thrive. The success of the human
race as a species has depended on us receiving care and being motivated to give care to others. When this
is working well, humans work together, supporting each other and flourishing. Whilst receiving care from
other people is of course very important, we now know that it is very narrow to think that we can only
fulfil this need for care through other people. Fulfilling our need for care and nurture ourselves, can also be
extremely valuable.

**Mental Health and Well Being Benefits**
Research has shown that self-compassion is strongly linked to our mental health and well-being. Studies
have found that those who are more compassionate towards themselves tend to have less mental health
problems, like depression, anxiety and stress. These people also tend to have a better quality of life, a
greater sense of well-being, and less problems in relationships. Compassion is linked to the hormone
oxytocin, often called the “love” hormone. This is a hormone that promotes bonding and closeness, and
therefore is particularly active at childbirth, during physical affection, during sex, when parents play with
their children, when people play with their pets, etc. It is suggested that directing compassion inwards can
equally trigger the release of oxytocin, and the calming benefits it brings. In essence, self-compassion goes
hand in hand with general life contentment, something we could all do with a dose of.

**Balancing Our Emotions**
The reason why self-compassion might bring us such wonderful benefits, is via its proposed vital role in
helping to balance our emotions. Paul Gilbert has written extensively about the idea that our emotions are
governed by three systems known as the **threat**, **drive** and **soothe** systems, with each playing an
important role in regulating our emotions.

Threat: Generally speaking all living creatures are good at anticipating and avoiding
threat in order to survive. This protective mechanism is hard wired within us all.
Couple this with the human ability to think a lot, and we find that the human mind
seems to have a default setting to look for, pay attention to and repetitively think about
bad stuff. This results in our threat system being active and in overdrive a lot.

No longer are we in caveman times where the presence of a sabre tooth tiger is the type of thing that
triggers our threat system. In today’s society, small mistakes or perceived flaws in our abilities, appearance,
social skills, etc, are all seen as threats. These sorts of things are seen as risks to our reputation, social
status, relationships, career, finances, health, future or happiness. So our threat system seems to be on high
alert for many of us most of the time, always on the lookout for potential dangers in order to protect
ourselves.

### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~

When active the threat system leads to emotional responses such as anxiety, anger, or depression. These
emotions are all about motivating us to protect ourselves, with anger prompting us to confront and defeat
danger, anxiety prompting us to shy away from danger, and depression prompting us to shut down from
danger. As such, the threat system also generates corresponding behavioural responses such as to ‘fight’
(i.e., aggression), ‘flight’ (i.e., avoidance) or ‘freeze’ (i.e., being submissive or passive).

When we are in threat mode our thinking becomes very narrow and negative. Our mind doesn’t seem to
budge easily from its narrow negative focus when it is in this state. It is very difficult to think in balanced,
reasonable, rationale ways when in threat mode, as this requires quite sophisticated thinking by our brain.
Our brain wasn’t designed to be sophisticated when it thinks we are in danger. Sophisticated thinking takes
up time, something you have little of if you really are in danger. By contrast, narrow negative thinking is
very quick. This is really important to know, as people often berate themselves for their seemingly
‘irrational’ thinking when they are experiencing distressing emotions, not realising that essentially their mind
was built to be irrational when it senses danger.

Now the threat system is not a bad thing. Remember, its purpose is to keep us safe from legitimate threats
(e.g., getting out of the way of a moving car). However, many of our mental health problems relate to the
threat system being active too much of the time when there is no real danger.

Drive: The drive system spurs us on to try new things, achieve things, set and work
towards goals, and feel those ecstatic ‘high five moments’ when we have those ‘wins’ in
life. The drive system is what energises us to get things done and be active in life.
Having ‘drive’ is great, because it keeps us progressing in life. Without our drive system
being active some of the time, we would be rather lifeless and directionless, a problem
that can occur when we feel depressed.

The problem is that this system, like the threat system, can also kick into overdrive. This particularly
happens if we live in a society that is highly competitive, and gives us the message that we always need to
do more and be better, and if we don’t achieve this then there is something wrong with us. What can
happen is that when we don’t succeed in our goals, which understandably is not always possible to do, then
we can quickly flip from the drive system into the threat system. And so, we can become trapped in an
unhealthy pattern of… _drive, drive, drive_ (e.g., “I must achieve, achieve, achieve”), and when we hit a barrier
then it is _threat, threat, threat_ (e.g., “I’ve failed and so now lots of bad stuff is going to happen to me”).

Soothe: The soothe system is very different, and has a calming influence on both the threat and drive
systems, helping to quieten them down when they are overactive. The soothe system is at work when we
are just chilling out, feeling safe, calm and content. You can’t be in threat and soothe mode at the same
time, and you can’t be in drive and soothe mood at the same time.

Experiences of kindness and care tend to stimulate the soothe system. Whilst receiving compassion from
others is one way to unlock the soothe system, self-compassion is another key. These modules are really
about finding this key and using it whenever we need to calm the threat and drive systems, by bringing the
soothe system online to balance our emotions.

### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~
#### **The Opposite of Self-Compassion…Self-Criticism**

For most people, being compassionate towards themselves and therefore activating the
soothe system doesn’t come naturally. However the opposite of self-compassion, selfcriticism, seems to very easily roll off the tongue. Self-criticism is a thinking style that
involves our internal self-talk being highly negative, disparaging and berating. Selfcriticism can therefore activate the threat system in and of itself, or once the threat
system is active for other reasons, responding by being critical of ourselves can keep the
threat system alive.

The content of self-critical thoughts can be very cruel and the tone very cold, harsh, and attacking. It is like
we are telling off or reprimanding ourselves in a most unkind or punishing way. This thinking style occurs
within us all to varying degrees, and is very common in our society. You will tend to hear most people
refer to themselves as “stupid” or “idiot” when they make a small mistake. This may be at the milder end
of self-criticism. Others may routinely speak to themselves harshly, while others may frequently hurl a
barrage of abuse at themselves. Some harsh self-critics may experience a sense of self-loathing, self-hatred
or self-disgust, where they believe they don’t deserve to treat themselves any better.

Some common examples of self-critical statements might sound something like:


_I am an idiot…what a moron…you are useless and pathetic…I am so hopeless…_
_You shouldn’t have done that….why did I do that… you should have known better…_

_I never get it right… you may as well give up now…there is no point, why bother…_


You will notice that some self-critics refer to themselves in the first person ( _I am…_ ), whilst others may
refer to themselves using a second person perspective ( _you are…_ ). You will also notice that self-criticism
often involves the following unhelpful thinking styles:

**Labelling:** making global and derogatory statements about ourselves on the basis of our behaviour in a
specific situation;
**Shoulding:** using "should" statements to put unreasonable demands or pressure on ourselves; and
**Overgeneralising:** taking one negative instance and concluding that this applies to everything.

To gain more awareness of your own self-critical thinking style, consider the following questions:

**What do you typically criticise yourself for?**
#### ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________

**What sorts of things do you typically say to yourself/about yourself?**
#### ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________

**How do you say these things? What does your internal voice sound like? Does it remind you**
**of anyone?**
#### ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________

### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~

**When you criticise yourself, how does it make you feel?**
#### ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________

**What do you think the negative consequences are of speaking to yourself like this?**
#### ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________

I wonder what you noted for how self-criticism makes you feel and any other negative consequences you
recognised. One big negative consequence is that self-criticism doesn’t make you feel very good, and
usually leads to feelings like anxiety, sadness, depression, guilt, shame or anger. Self-criticism is common
across lots of mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, body image
issues, low self-esteem, etc), and can contribute to staying stuck in these problems. Therefore, addressing
self-criticism by building the ability to instead be self-compassionate, may play a role in improving some of
these difficulties.

While you may have acknowledged some negative consequences of being self-critical, many people don’t
realise that they can often hold positive beliefs about the benefits of being critical towards themselves.
Module 2 will look in more detail about why we talk to ourselves in a critical manner, and what our mind
might be trying to achieve when it does this, as our mind typically doesn’t do things for no good reason.

#### **Why is it Hard to be Self-Compassionate?**


So if self-criticism is just leading to more misery, then surely self-compassion is the answer. But, it ain’t that
simple. Most people struggle to be more compassionate towards themselves. If this applies to you, please
know you are not alone and there can be a number of reasons for this.

**Early Life Experiences**
It is proposed that for some people, experiencing limited care, kindness and nurturing from others growing
up, leads to the soothe system being underdeveloped. The soothe system thrives on and is stimulated by
having compassionate experiences. Essentially, it is hard to learn something that you were never taught.
So, if you didn’t receive much compassion from others in earlier life, then it is understandable that is can be
more difficult to develop the ability to be compassionate to yourself later in life.

**The Threat System**
As already mentioned, our brain is hard wired to shift into threat mode pretty easily to protect ourselves.
Seeing the negative is our default attention bias. Turning our attention to more self-compassionate
endeavours is therefore overriding this attention bias, which is not something that comes naturally to us.

**Lack of Awareness**
Many of us may not be aware that we are struggling, or aware of the unhelpful critical ways we may be
treating ourselves. We can go through life on autopilot, doing what we have always done. We get tangled
and stuck in our struggle, never pausing to consciously recognise we are struggling, and that maybe we
could deal with this in the same way we might help others deal with something similar. It has just never
even occurred to us that treating ourselves kindly is an option.

### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~

**Negative Beliefs about Self-Compassion**
Some of us may cringe at the idea of self-compassion. Being self-compassionate is not something we are
taught about or talk about a lot, and so it can carry some negative connotations. Some people think being
self-compassionate is too ‘touchy feely’, and will lead to laziness, self-indulgence or self-pity. Rest assured,
self-compassion is none of these things, and we will address these sorts of beliefs that can be a barrier to
being more self-compassionate in Module 2.

#### **Do You Need to Build More Self-Compassion?**


Everyone can benefit from a bit more self-compassion. It is not really something you can have too much of.
However, this sort of approach was particularly developed for people who are very harsh self-critics, even
to the extent of feeling self-loathing or hatred. For these people, developing self-compassion is especially
important, and may also take more time and effort.

For some people, being more compassionate towards themselves can be a frightening experience often
because of past traumatic experiences. If this is the case for you, and you are struggling to put into practice
some of the strategies from the coming modules, then we would recommend being supported by a mental
health professional as you work your way through these modules.


To help you make the decision about whether you want to proceed further into
these modules, have a go at the following quiz to get a sense of how selfcompassionate you are. The more items you tick, the more self-critical you are likely
to be, indicating that you could benefit from an ‘injection’ of self-compassion.

### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~
#### **About These Modules…**

Drawing together some of the concepts discussed in this module, the bottom line is this…

When our brain detects some sort of _**trigger**_ or ‘problem’ (which could be a particular situation we are in,
or just thinking about past or future negative events, or an uncomfortable emotion or physical sensation we
may be experiencing), then it quickly and automatically shifts into threat mode.

With the _**threat system activated**_, all sorts of _**emotional, behavioural and physical responses**_
that can be quite unpleasant then follow. Many of us then deal with this via self-criticism, either criticising
ourselves for the original trigger or our subsequent response to the trigger. Therefore, we may be
criticising ourselves for the situation we find ourselves in; our actions or inactions in the past, present or
future; or our own emotional and physical reactions in that moment.

_**Self-criticism**_ tends to be our way of trying to deal with problems for a variety of reasons, including a
_**lack of awareness**_ of our own struggle and our self-critical way of dealing with things, holding _**positive**_
_**beliefs about self-criticism**_ as being a helpful thing to do, as well as holding _**negative beliefs about**_
_**self-compassion**_ that can make us reluctant to take a compassionate tone with ourselves.

However, the _**consequences**_ of all of this, is that self-criticism only serves
to keep the threat system active, and so our uncomfortable emotional,
behavioural and physical responses continue. In essence, self-criticism
prolongs our pain and suffering, keeping us stuck and unable to move
forward from the struggle we are facing. The Self-Critical Cycle on page 9
summarises this trap we can find ourselves stuck in.

### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~

The solution to this unhelpful cycle is to step out of self-criticism and calm the threat system, by stimulating
the soothe system. Self-compassion is a key way of activating the soothe system and its calming influence.
There are many ways of building self-compassion, and the modules ahead will cover some of the main
methods. It will be important to try the various methods with an open and curious mind, to discover
which work well for you, as everyone is different. The aim of all of these modules is to find ways to
stimulate the soothe system, to elicit an attitude of kindness, warmth, concern, understanding and strength
within us, and then use this attitude to respond to our own struggles, rather than reverting to our usual
self-critical habits.


With this in mind, the modules ahead are divided into 3 main aims. The first aim is **developing** selfcompassion, by preparing you to find the method that works best for you in turning your soothe system
on. The second aim is **applying** self-compassion, so that once the soothe system is switched on, it then
positively guides how you think and behave. And the final aim is **maintaining** self-compassion in your day
to day living, so that you know what to do to keep being self-compassionate over the long term. The
following is a preview of what is to come in the modules ahead…


Developing Self-Compassion:
Module 2 Barriers to Self-Compassion
Module 3 Preparing for Self-Compassion
Module 4 Compassionate Imagery


Applying Self-Compassion:
Module 5 Self-Compassionate Thinking
Module 6 Self-Compassionate Behaviour


Maintaining Self-Compassion:
Module 7 Self-Compassionate Living


As already mentioned, building greater self-compassion can be useful in and of itself, or it can be a helpful
addition to addressing other more specific issues we may be facing such as depression, anxiety, anger,
eating disorders, body image issues, perfectionism, procrastination, low self-esteem, self-harm, etc. For
some of these sorts of problems, we have more specific Infopax available that target these specific issues.
Therefore, this _Build Self-Compassion_ Infopax can complement the activities suggested in other Infopax,
helping you to take a self-compassionate attitude when practicing the other strategies suggested, which may
make these other strategies even more effective.


You could choose to work through this _Building Self-Compassion_ Infopax first, and then move on to other
Infopax that are relevant to you, so that you may get more out of them. Or vice versa. You could start
with other more specific Infopax, and then use this _Building Self-Compassion_ Infopax to enhance and make
more powerful the skills you have already learnt in the other modules. There is no right or wrong way to
go about this, but we would recommend completing one Infopax at a time.


If you do decide to work through these modules, we would recommend completing them in the order they
are set out and completing all modules for maximum benefit. The time taken to complete each module will
vary from person to person. When making the decision about whether it is time to move on to the next
module, ensure that you are giving yourself enough time to become familiar with and practice the practical
exercises suggested in a module before moving on to the next module.

### ~~Building Self-Compassion~~
#### **Module Summary**


- Self-compassion is compassion directed towards ourselves.

- Self-compassion involves being aware of our own pain and suffering, and understanding that this is a
hard, but normal human experience. Directing feelings of kindness and care towards ourselves, and
focusing our attention and energy on how we might alleviate our pain, are also crucial components
of self-compassion.

- Self-compassion can bring great benefits for our mental health and well-being. Particularly, selfcompassion can activate our soothe system, which calms the threat and drive systems. Our threat
and drive systems tend to be overactive for many of us much of the time, and responsible for the
difficult emotions we may be struggling with (e.g., anxiety, anger, depression).

- The opposite of self-compassion is self-criticism. This very negative thinking style often links to
difficult emotions and mental health problems. Those who are highly self-critical particularly need
to develop the ability to relate to themselves in a compassionate way.

- We can get stuck in a self-critical cycle, where any problem we face activates our threat system,
and anxious, angry or depressive responses then follow. If we then use self-criticism as our way of
dealing with whatever we are going through, that just keeps the threat system active, and keeps us
stuck in the problem and our emotional suffering.

- An alternative to self-criticism is self-compassion, but being self-compassionate is hard for most of
us for various reasons. However, these modules will help us to overcome these difficulties,
allowing us to develop self-compassion, apply it in our daily lives to guide our thinking and actions,
and maintain this new way of living over the long term.

##### Coming up next …

In Module 2, we will address any
barriers that may get in the way of
building self-compassion…
