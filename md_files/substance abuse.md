The aim of this report is to provide an updated description of different methods used
around the world to treat health problems associated with substance use.


The scope of treatment approaches currently practised around the world is wide,
ranging from traditional healing practices via mutual self-help groups,
psychological/behavioural treatment to pharmacological treatment.


Also included is a chapter on the generalist responses to alcohol and other drug
problems and a chapter on the concept of harm minimization.


Another aspect is a chapter on specific descriptors, which distinguishes different
treatments from one another and provides economic means of describing them. Social
and structural extra-treatment factors influencing the treatment process are also a
subject described in this report.

**INTRODUCTION**


This report is an attempt to provide an updated description of different methods used around the world to treat health
problems associated with substance use. Its structure was developed at two consultation meetings held in 1991 (in
Moscow, Russia, and in St Petersinsel, Switzerland) organized by the WHO Programme on Substance Abuse and
supported fmancially by UNDCP.


All the chapters reflect the points of view of their authors and do not represent official WHO policies or
recommendations. Whilst every attempt has been made to be as comprehensive as possible, it is obvious that the
choice of where to put emphasis is somewhat arbitrary. The chapters have been edited only so as to ensure
reasonable consistency of terminology. It is obvious that some chapters and sections thereof or particular techniques
or interventions will have greater applicability to certain areas of the world, population groups or culture.


Because of lack of space, many issues could not be discussed in as much depth as they merit. For example, in the
chapter on pharmacological treatments, the description of the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol
withdrawal. Other examples include rather brief discussions of the trend in some countries to merge alcohol and drug
dependence treatment services and of the problem of providing suitable treatment for those suffering psychiatric eomorbidity. There are probably many more such examples, but it is hoped that they will not detract from the main
thrust of the report, which is to describe in broad terms the range of treatment approaches currently being practised
around the world.


A companion report entitled _National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Responses in 23 Countries,_ WHO/PSN93.15,
provides another view of this topic by analysing the results of a key informant enquiry undertaken in various
countries in the developed and developing world. The two reports should be read in conjunction with one another.

**I.** **DESCRIPTORS OF TREATMENTS**


_POLONIUS: The actors are come hither, my lord ... The best actors in the_
_world, either for tragedy, comedy, historical, pastoral, pastoral-comical,_
_historical-pastoral,_ _tragical-historical,_ _tragical-comical-historical-_
_classical, scene indivisible, or poem unlimited ..._


Hamlet. Act II, Scene ii


Poor Polonius' bumbling attempt to categorise dramatic presentations runs into difficulty vety quickly
because of their great variety. Treatments may be viewed as the theatre of the alcohol and drug field, in
which the differing actors (here in the generic sense) play out their several roles in accord with a scenario
that is predetermined to at least some degree. The classification of treatments, like that of theatrical
presentations, becomes problematic in the face of their massive diversity.


Are treatments for alcohol and drug problems truly diverse? The empirical evidence is affrrmative. At
the WHO Consultation Meeting on mapping the treatment response to alcohol and drug abuse, held in
Moscow. 28-31 May 1991, there was a consensus that "treatment responses to alcohol and drug abuse
vacy considerably around the world" (WHO, 1991 ). This variability has also been noted within individual
countries. A report from the USA (Institute of Medicine, 1990) observed that "there are now many
different methods of treatment for alcohol problems". The foregoing material in the present report amply
supports these statements.


Polonius' classification dilemma thus extends to the present discussion. No consensus has arisen on the
classification of treatments for alcohol and drug problems. A taxonomy of treatments, as the desired
classification is sometimes called, has proven elusive. Perhaps the reason is that treatments, being
complex, have multiple salient characteristics. A taxonomy requires that a hierarchy be constructed in
which certain characteristics are given more weight in the process of classification than others. It has been
difficult to achieve agreement on which of the many characteristics of treatments are of greater relevance.


In this chapter, no attempt will be made to create a taxonomy. Rather, a number of critical dimensions
on which treatments tend to differ from one another will be discussed. The overall goal will be to arrive
at a small set of specific descriptors that can both distinguish different treatments from one another and
provide an economic means of describing them. If agreement can be reached subsequently that some
descriptors are more important than others, it may prove possible to construct a true taxonomy.
Alternatively, however, the dimensions could become elements of a database that would permit the
exploration of the properties of treatments in a systematic and interactive manner.


The art of describing treatments in this field is not well developed, and the present chapter should be
considered tentative rather than definitive. Discussion and commentacy will modify the proposed matrix.
For the moment, however, a dozen descriptors of treatment will be discussed. They are listed here for
convenience (a more complete listing, with subheadings, may be found in Appendix I) and are further defmed in the balance of the chapter. The descriptors to be considered include the following:


WHO/PSA/93.10

modality
philosophy
stage specificity
setting
target
provider
time frame
efficacy
cost
availability
utilization
organizational characteristics.


Before proceeding, a distinction should be made between treatments and treatment programmes.
Treatments are specific activities directed at individuals who have alcohol or drug problems or at other
interactive units to which they are related (see discussion under "Target" below) in the hope of improving
their status. Treatment programmes are the administrative contexts within which these specific activities
occur. A given treatment programme often offers only one form of treatment (Glaser, Greenberg &
Barrett, 1978). However, some programmes (so-called "multimodality" programmes) offer more than a
single treatment. In applying the following descriptors of treatments to a treatment programme, it may
be most appropriate initially to determine whether more than one kind of treatment is being offered within
the context of the programme, and then to apply the descriptors to each of these treatments in turn.


**MODALITY**


As the Institute of Medicine report notes, the "specific activities that are used to relieve symptoms or to
induce behaviour change are referred to as modalities" (Institute of Medicine, 1990). In the same
paragraph the term "modality" is viewed as denoting the content of treatment. This descriptor heads the
list because it defines what is being described. It is quite specific; for example, the clinical deployment
of a particular drug such as methadone or a particular psychotherapy such as Rogerian client-centred
counselling, for instance. Other descriptors, such as philosophy or stage of treatment, are more inclusive,
will potentially contain within them many modalities, and are therefore often what is discussed first when
varieties of treatment are being described (Institute of Medicine, 1990). But when a treatment is being
selected for use, it is commonly the modality that is the operative descriptor.


In addition to identifying the modality by name, this descriptor should probably contain three additional
elements: the type of modality, the therapeutic strategy that it employs and the goals that it is attempting

to achieve. Each of these elements will be discussed in turn. An attempt will be made to categorise within
each element, though this will not always be possible in the current state of knowledge.


WHO/PSA/93.10

Types


Five broad types of modality can be readily identified: biophysical, pharmacological, psychologic"al,
sociocultural and mixed modalities that combine more than a single type. To give some examples, the
passage of an electric current through the brain, extra- or intracranial cooling of portions of the l:)rain, or
the insertion of needles i."lto the skin would be considered a biophysical modalit}r. The use of methadone,
disulfiram or other drugs would be considered a pharmacological modality, while a therapeutic community
would be considered a sociocultural modality.,


A problem immediately poses itself regarding the "purity" of the classification scheme. It could ·be argued,
that the use of methadone is best classified as a mixed modality, because elements such as counselling and
job training are ordinarily employed at the same time. But it will quickly be seen that, if this approach is
used, almost all modalities will be classified as mixed. It may be preferable to try to be as rigorous and
as diverse as possible in using the typology suggested, and to consider the counselling that may
accompany methadone treatment as an additional modality or as an adjuvant not requiring separate
classification.


Another problem is posed by traditional methods of healing. It is tempting to create a special category
for them. However, traditional methods are quite diverse and to lump them together in a single category
will obscure their diversity. Those that involve primarily the administration of substances derived from
plants or animals might best be characterized as pharmacological modalities, while those that primarily
employ rituals might be characterized as sociocultural. Others, such as the peyote ceremony of the Native
American Church, are perhaps most accurately classified as mixed, the caution entered above against the
overuse of this category notwithstanding. The reason is that both the pharmacological effects of the drugs
and the careful structuring of the ritual seem equally important contributors to the overall experience
(Bergman, 1971).


Strategies


Although with further experience it may become possible to categorize strategies, at the present time they
are best explained by narrative description. The strategy utilized in a given modality is the means by
which that modality attempts to achieve its goals. In a way, it is an answer to the question, "How does it
work?" Perhaps the best known description of a strategy for the treatment of alcohol problems is the 12
steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). The steps outline in a detailed but succinct and sequential manner
the way in which an individual AA member should attempt to achieve the goal of sobriety. It is not too
much to say that the carefully crafted account of its strategy is one of the principal attractions of AA and
it is not swprising that it has been widely imitated by other mutual help organizations.


To provide an example from another type of modality, the strategic approach of disulfrram (antabuse)
administration involve3 creating the fear of a markedly distressing physical response to the ingestion of
alcohol through the daily administration of a drug that inhibits alcohol metabolism and causes the
accumulation of a highly toxic compound, acetaldehyde. Because of the high probability that alcohol
consumption will result in this reaction, consumption is avoided, or so the theory goes. A second strategic
element in the use of disulfrram is a consequence of the relatively long duration of its action; once a


WHO/PSA/93.10
page6


sufficient degree of loading has occurred, the drug need be taken only once per day. This can be done at
a time of day, usually in the morning, when the desire to drink is characteristically low, and in a sense
limits the number of daily decision points around whether to drink to a single one i.e. the decision to take
the drug. A further strategy sometimes deployed in disulfiram treatment is the supervised or even enforced
taking of the drug, though some feel this procedure raises serious ethical and legal concerns (Marco &
Marco, 1980; Schafer, 1981).


Psychoanalytic psychotherapy provides an example of a psychological strategy. Significant conflicts of
early development are recreated through the medium of an intense relationship with the therapist (the socalled "transference"). These conflicts can then be worked through to a resolution. This in turn allows
the resumption of the arrested developmental process that is viewed as the ultimate cause of the
problematic behaviour. Relapse prevention provides another example of a psychological strategy:
situations in which there is a high probability of drinking are identified and alternative methods of coping
with these situations are developed, rehearsed and implemented. In some instances a short-acting
antabuse-like drug, carbamide (Temposil), is used as an early coping alternative (Peachey & Annis, 1985),
but the eventual goal is to develop non-pharmacological coping responses. Hence relapse prevention of
this kind is best understood as a psychological modality, even though a drug may be used as a temporary
measure. Alternatively, as with the counselling component of methadone maintenance treatment (see
above), the pharmacological aspect ofthis kind of relapse prevention could be separately described.


These examples demonstrate that the description of the strategy of a treatment modality is an attempt to
capture its distinctive characteristics in a nutshell. For such an attempt to succeed requires thorough
familiarity with the modality. It also requires a degree of willingness to endure criticism, since many
practitioners will not be sanguine about any attempt to describe what they do. They are correct in thinking
it is not an easy task Hopefully they may at length be recruited into the attempt, the process of consensus
development is important in elucidating strategies. With greater experience, a direct and simple means
of categorizing strategies may be developed.


Goals


In terms of the possible goals of treatment modalities, the first is to modify alcohol or drug taking directly.
While virtually all modalities have an ultimate goal of reducing or eliminating alcohol or drug
consumption, few actually target consumption itself. Changes in consumption frequently lie at the end
of a chain of modifications of other factors that are produced by various treatments. For example, there
are a number of drugs that reduce the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin at synaptic clefts in the
central nervous system and this in turn may result, several steps down the line, in reduced alcohol intake.
However, treatment approaches that systematically teach elements of drinking behaviour, such as sipping
rather than gulping drinks, or that set rules for the number of drinks per occasion or per time unit are
examples of treatment approaches that attempt to modify consumption directly.


The goal of other treatments is to modify the antecedents of alcohol or drug taking. Some persons increase
their consumption of alcohol when they become depressed or anxious and, in these instances, treatment
of their mental state is undertaken both for its own sake and in the hope of reducing the consumption that
is felt to be its consequence. A deeply troubling traumatic life event may create continuing distress that


WHO/PSA/93.10
page7


can be associated with excessive use of alcohol or drugs. Effective treatment of this post-traumatic stress
disorder is indicated to relieve the alcohol or drug problem.


In some instances, aversive environmental or interpersonal stresses such as a high-pressure job, a chaotic
family situation or a chronically pathological marriage may become the antecedents to quite severe alcohol
or drug problems, and dealing directly with these stresses may be the treatment approach of choice. A
cautionary note, however, should be sounded here. While some instances of alcohol and drug problems
can be related to clear-cut antecedents, experience suggests that many such problems have no defmable
antecedents. Moreover, even where antecedents exist, alcohol and drug problems, especially those of long
duration, may become autonomous and perpetuate themselves quite independently of whatever their
initiating cause may have been historically. In such an instance, dealing with the antecedent would have
no effect on the problem. Hence the goals of treatment, as with treatment itself, must be selected with care
and must be tailored to the individual case.


Finally, a modification of the consequences of alcohol or drug consumption may be the goal of treatment.
Liver transplantation is one example; the "insobriety pill" that has long been sought is another. To date,
no systematic review of the goals of treatment for alcohol and drug problems has been undertaken. Hence
it is not clear which of the three goals is most frequently attempted. It is quite difficult, however, to
enumerate examples of treatments directed at consumption or at the consequences of consumption. This
may suggest one possible use of detailed treatment mapping: assisting in identifying the need for the
development of more interventions that have specific characteristics.


**PHILOSOPHY**


For the purposes of this discussion, the philosophy of a treatment will be taken to mean the view it
proposes as to how alcohol or drug problems develop in an individual. That is, philosophy in this
particular context represents an accounting of etiology. A considerable amount of work has been done
on models of etiology in the alcohol and drug field (Siegler, Osmond & Newell, 1968; Siegler & Osmond,

1968; Brickman et al., 1982; Brower, Blow & Beresford, 1989). Drawing upon this work, a
categorization of philosophies can be proposed that includes moral models, spiritual and existential
models, biological models, psychological models, sociocultural models and integrative models. The use
of the plural is deliberate as multiple variants of each model exist.


Objection has been raised that the categories proposed for philosophies of treatment are very similar to
those proposed for modalities and therefore that the two are so closely linked so as not to require separate
consideration. While it is true that there is a general parallelism making it likely that, for example, a
psychological modality will be underpinned by a psychological model of etiology, this does not always
hold The use of narcotic antagonists such as naltrexone, for instance, is based not on a biological model
of etiology, as would be expected from parallelism, but on a psychological model. In this case the drug
problem is based on the development of a conditioned response and the antagonist is used to extinguish
the response. Aversive conditioning methods, such as those that employ apomorphine or succinyl choline,
are operationally psychological in nature but do not necessarily subscribe to a psychological model of
etiology.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 8


This sort of etiologic/operational disjunction is common to therapeutics generally. The genetic problem
of phenylketonuria or phenylpyruvic oligophrenia, a potential cause of serious mental retardation arising
from an inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism, is dealt with through dietary restriction. Familial
dysautonomia, or Best-Riley-Day syndrome, the congenital absence of the ability to experience physical
pain, is dealt with by training methods based on learning theoty. The same is true of early infantile autism.
Schizophrenia, which may have a biological basis, is commonly dealt with through psychological and
sociocultural means, the drugs that are commonly used are seen as adjunctive rather than curative as well.
Thus, because they do not invariably parallel each other, it seems justified to discuss modality and
philosophy separately. The proposed categories of etiologic models, or treatment philosophies, will now
be briefly discussed.


Moral models


Moral models emphasize sin, weakness and pleasure-seeking as causes for a departure from acceptable
behaviour. Insobriety is a manifestation of a moral lapse. Redemption through the reattainment of
sobriety is achieved by an act of willpower, ideally accompanied by contrition. Given the nature of the
problem as viewed in the context of this model, the appropriate intervention is punishment.


Few current treatment interventions are based principally on the moral model, perhaps because of the
dominance of the so-called "disease concept", a biological model of etiology that is explicitly opposed to
construing alcohol or drug problems in moral terms. It is of interest, however, that in the USA, where the
"disease concept" originated and has been most vigorously advocated, surveys regularly show that a
significant proportion of the population continues to view these problems in moral terms (Mulford &
Miller, 1961; Haberman&Shenberg, 1969; Rodin, 1981; Caetano, 1987; Moore, 1972). Thesefmdings
assist in understanding why the principal policy initiative in the USA is the "war on drugs", with its
preponderant emphasis upon law enforcement, an approach entirely consistent with the moral model. A
committed captain in that war, the head of drug law enforcement in a large midwestern state and a former
prosecuting attorney, has written: " ... this is a war for the hearts, minds, and souls of our children. There
is no place to which we can withdraw. We can run, but we can never hide ... The real issue is ... essentially
a moral one" (Peterson, 1991).


Spiritual and existential models


Spiritual and existential models relate alcohol and drug problems to defects in dealing with ultimate or
self-transcending concerns, either theological (spiritual) or non-theological (existential). They tend to
view such problems as manifestations of undue self-concern or egoism and offer a broader perspective
directed away from the self as a corrective. Spiritual models are likely to be operative in treatments that
are either frankly religious or are derived from religious antecedents. An example of the former is the
Teen Challenge drug treatment programme of the Pentecostal Church in the USA; another is the templebased treatment programmes in Thailand. Among the treatment programmes that are derived from
religious antecedents is Alcoholics Anonymous (Jones, 1970; Glaser, 1981). Those in AA may at times
refer to a somewhat diffuse Higher Power rather than to God specifically, but on the other hand they stress
spirituality as the centre of their programme. In the drug-free therapeutic communities that evolved out
of AA may be witnessed a transition from the spiritual to the existential. The community itself is the self

page 9


transcendent entity used as a reference point. There are other forms of treatment that may be used for
alcohol and drug problems that derives originally from existential rather than from spiritual models, such
as the logotherapy ofViktor Frankl (Frankl, 1969).


**Biological models**


Biological models assume a physiologic or metabolic abnormality, often with a genetic basis, as the central
etiologic factor. The originators of methadone maintenance treatment suggested that heroin addiction was
the result of a metabolic deficiency that was corrected when methadone was administered (Dole &
Nyswander, 1967). Russian narcologists have expressed the conviction that both alcohol and drug
problems are the result of errors in dopamine metabolism and have recommended corrective drug
treatments. An exclusively genetic basis for alcohol problems has gained widespread support (Petrakis,
1985), though some remain unconvinced that this can be demonstrated by currently available data
(Searles, 1988).


The most familiar variant among the biological models is the so-called "disease concept of alcoholism".
Its most detailed and scholarly exposition is in the classic work by EM Jellinek (Jellinek, 1960), though
the concept was popularized earlier by what has been called "the alcoholism movement" in the USA
(Room, 1983). A central tenet of the disease concept has been that individuals develop severe problems
with alcohol, or alcoholism, through no fault of their own, as happens with an actual disease, and hence
they should not be blamed for their problems. It is felt that blame, and the stigma attached to it, prevents
many alcoholics from recognizing their problems and dealing with them. For this reason, proponents of
the disease concept often see themselves in opposition to proponents of the moral model, according to
which blame and consequent punishment are appropriate.


While the disease concept has some vigorous advocates who insist that all instances of problems related
to alcohol consumption, severe or not, are manifestations of the disease of alcoholism, it is worth noting
that EM Jellinek was not among them. He delineated a number of sub types of alcoholism ("species", in
his terminology) and asserted that only two could appropriately be viewed as diseases. Although the
disease concept is characteristically associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, the AA model is in fact far
more complex and includes elements other than the biological (see below).


**Psychological models**


While psychological models of etiology have an overall consistency in viewing alcohol and drug problems
as arising principally from various states of mind, there are at least two major subtypes. In one, the use
of alcohol or drugs is viewed as arising from emotional dysfunction or conflict, with the substance of
choice often providing symptomatic relief (McLellan, Woody & O'Brien, 1979; Khantzian, 1985; see also
Leake, 1965). In the other subtype, such use is thought to derive from maladaptive learning patterns,
either on the basis of classical conditioning ( Wikler, 1965) or of instrumental learning (Becker, 1953).
Related psychotherapies - psychodynamic for the emotional distress subtype and behavioural for the
learned response subtype - are often viewed as the appropriate respective modalities for treatment.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 10


**Sociocultural models**


Sociocultural models "[consider] alcohol [and drug] problems to be the result of a lifelong socialization
process in a particular social and cultural milieu" (Institute of Medicine, 1990). When a patient at the
United States of America Public Health Service Hospital at Lexington, Kentucky was asked during the
course of a routine initial interview why she took heroin, she looked puzzled and, after a pause, replied,
"Well, Doctor, when you got to be my age in my neighbourhood, that was what you did" (Chein et al.,
1964). A family, like a neighbourhood, can be considered "a particular social and cultural milieu", and
there has been much interest in the notion that the use of alcohol or drugs by a particular family member
may be the result of an intrafamilial problem. Increasing attention is being paid to the effect upon other
family members of the person with alcohol or drug problems (Woititz, 1983; West & Prinz, 1987;
Gomberg, 1989; Harburg et al., 1990). This approach is also consistent with a sociocultural model of
etiology.


Non-Western societies have different sociocultural models which are further discussed in the chapter on
"The Role of Traditional Health in the Management of Substance Abuse".


**Integrative models**


Finally, there are integrative models of etiology that combine elements from other models. The fourfold
response of the committee responsible for the Institute of Medicine report to the question of etiology
exemplifies this approach:


l. There is no likelihood that a single cause will be identified for all instances of alcohol [or drug]
problems.


2. There is every likelihood that the range of causes that interact to produce alcohol [or drug]
problems in the population can be identified.


3. Alcohol [and drug] problems will prove to be the result of different interactions of different
etiological factors in different individuals.


4. While effective treatment will be served by a more precise knowledge of etiology, effective
treatment is possible in the absence of such knowledge (Institute of Medicine, 1990).


The Institute of Medicine statement on etiology is an example of what has been called the multi variant
model. Another variety of integrative model is that of the ubiquitous mutual help organization, Alcoholics
Anonymous. AA is frequently viewed as espousing the disease model. Yet while AA members do
characteristically refer to "the disease of alcoholism", this is only one strand in a complex fabric of
postulates regarding etiology (Brower, Blow, & Beresford, 1989). The spiritual aspects of AA seem in
many respects to be more prominent than the biological. There is also a strong sociocultural element in
AA, which is a group effort that places high emphasis on the value of "the fellowship" and on the social
interactions of members outside the structure of formal meetings. The AA sponsor, a more experienced
member who works closely with a neophyte on an individual basis, provides many different kinds of


_WHOIPSN93.10_

page 11


support. Although AA does tend to view the acquisition of alcohol problems as beyond the responsibility
of the individual, it clearly views it as the individual's responsibility to deal with those problems
(Brickman et al., 1982). Indeed, like many other integrative models, the AA model can accurately be
viewed as combining elements of all of the other models within itself.


STAGE SPECIFICITY


Treatment can conveniently be divided into stages, and various interventions seem to fit more comfortably
into one stage than another. Therefore the stage specificity of a particular treatment is an important
defining characteristic. The Institute of Medicine report identified three major stages of treatment, each
with subdivisions (Institute of Medicine, 1990). Following that lead, this .report will discuss the acute
treatment stage, the active treatment stage, and the maintenance stage of treatment


Acute treatment


Three subdivisions comprise the acute treatment stage. Among these is emergency treatment, which tries

to effect the immediate resolution of an acute physical, social or psychological emergency that may arise
in a given individual around his or her use of alcohol or drugs. Detoxification and withdrawal, though
often an emergent need, is sufficiently important to be a separate subdivision. It has been viewed as the
first of a series of six levels of cover for alcohol and drug problems in a stepwise scheme for the
development of treatment services (Glaser, 1992). It is the gateway through which many individuals enter
upon a course of treatment and is, in itself, a significant treatment.


The third subdivision of the acute treatment stage is screening. Large numbers of individuals who enter
the human services sector by different routes (e.g. through the health care system, the education system,
the social service system, the employee assistance system, the criminal justice and correctional systems)
will present difficulties appropriate to these systems but will ultimately prove to have alcohol and drug
problems (Institute of Medicine, 1990). A classic example is the individual who comes on multiple
occasions to an emergency department with repeated traumatic fractures; eventually it may be learned that
these occur when he or she is intoxicated. Unfortunately, alcohol and drug problems go largely
unrecognized in these settings. Only a systematic screening of these populations will consistently identify
those who have alcohol and drug problems and enable an appropriate plan of assistance to be
implemented. The need to do this arises not only from the desirability of providing effective assistance
to the individual, but from the necessity of controlling the costs that would otherwise fall upon the
community (Institute of Medicine, 1990). In the example above, much time, effort and money would be
saved if the alcohol problem underlying the repeated traumatic fractures was recognized and effectively
dealt with. Fortunately, promising work is now going forward on efficient methods of screening for
alcohol problems ( Saunders & Aasland, 1987; Babor et al., 1989). Screening for drug problems is less
well developed.

Active treatment


The active treatment stage includes not only the interventions that constitute what is commonly understood
by the term "treatment" but other activities that are considered to be an integral part of the treatment
process. Of particular importance is assessment, the attempt to obtain a comprehensive and objective
understanding of the nature and severity of the problems presented by each individual, and of the strengths
and liabilities of the individual herself or himself, with a view to developing a treatment plan by selecting
the most appropriate modality or modalities (treatment matching). An important assessment domain is
the evaluation of the health status of the individual. Not only do particular treatment interventions require
specific levels of physical health as a precondition for their successful negotiation, but the use of alcohol
and drugs may in itself create health problems. Of these perhaps the most disturbing at the present time
is the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the presence or absence of which must be considered
a crucial assessment parameter in all persons with alcohol and drug problems ( Selwyn, 1991 ).


The second subdivision of the active treatment stage is intervention, in which a specific modality of
treatment (or a combination or sequence of modalities ), selected as a consequence of information obtained
at assessment, is deployed. The interventions may be simple or complex and they may be brief or
extended in time span. The third subdivision is stabilization, by which an attempt is made to consolidate
the gains that have been effected through intervention, often by continuing the intervention at a less
frequently, and in a different setting. For example, interventions may be started in an inpatient or
residential setting but continued, for stabilization purposes, in a day programme or outpatient setting.


Maintenance


Maintenance is the fmal stage of treatment and also has three subdivisions: continuing care, relapse
prevention and supportive living arrangements. The term "continuing care" is suggested as a replacement
for the more commonly used "aftercare". Aftercare is difficult to defme and in some respects is a
pejorative term since it denotes activities that are less important than those that occur in the active
treatment phase. In fact, what happens after the active treatment phase may be of pre-eminent importance
in determining the eventual outcome (Cronkite & Moos, 1980). In the present context, continuing care
is a generic term that denotes the ongoing provision of some therapeutic input to maintain the gains
achieved in the acute treatment stage.


Although relapse prevention could be viewed as a component of continuing care, its increasing prominence
is such that it is accorded a separate subdivision in the maintenance stage. Relapse prevention refers to
the formal deployment of specific techniques to decrease the probability that a resumption of problematic
alcohol or drug use will occur following active treatment (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985; Annis, 1986; Gorski
& Miller, 1982). Individual instances of returning to drinking or drug taking ("slips") are viewed as
learning opportunities, rather than constituting unmitigated disasters. If properly understood and dealt
with, they can help to prevent further difficulties.


The use of the synthetic opiate methadone in the treatment of persons whose problems arise in the context
of opiate use is an illustration of a pharmacologic approach to relapse prevention. Sufficiently high doses
of methadone reduce the probability of the use of illicit opiates such as heroin, since methadone competes


WHO/PSN93.10

page 13


(successfully, because of the higher dosage) for opiate receptor sites in the brain and the (presumably
lower) doses of other opiates then have no effect. While this is felt to be the principal therapeutic effect
of methadone, the drug is also active in at least two other stages of treatment. Since methadone in
sufficient doses may substitute for other opiates, treatment regimes employing methadone do not require
withdrawal from opiates as a precondition of treatment and hence may attract individuals into treatment
who would otherwise avoid it. This was the initial rationale for its use (Dole, 1965). In this sense,
methadone could be said to be part of the emergency subdivision of the acute stage of treatment as defmed
above. (Methadone is frequently used to detoxify persons from other opiates, also a component of the
acute treatment stage, but its use as a treatment _per se_ is quite distinct from this use.) Additionally, by
providing methadone on a continuing basis while other modalities are also being provided (e.g.
counselling, job training) the need to seek illicit opiates during the active treatment phase, with the
disruptions of treatment this usually entails, is diminished. In this sense methadone could be said to be
part of the stabilization subdivision of the active treatment phase. Nevertheless, relapse prevention
appears to be the major therapeutic function of methadone and in this scheme it is suggested that it be
classified under this heading.


Supportive living arrangements, the final subdivision of the maintenance stage of treatment, involve the
provision of an ongoing supportive, protective living environment for those so disabled by prior alcohol
or drug use or those so likely to relapse that a return to independent community living is not advisable.
This category of the maintenance stage covers a spectrum of living arrangements ranging from temporary
placement in a halfway house to more permanent arrangements, up to and including domiciliary care.
Recent attention to the problem of homelessness, often if not invariably associated with alcohol and drug
problems, has underscored the importance of this subcategory of the maintenance phase of treatment. Yet
the idea is far from new, the Ghee) community in Belgium has from medieval times provided living
arrangements with its families for the mentally ill- a striking and admirable example of a supportive living
arrangement.


The inclusion here of long-term supportive living arrangements such as domiciliary care reflects the reality
of treatment limitations, especially when confronted with severe problems of long-standing alcohol and
drug problems. For example, most individuals suffering from Korsakofl's psychosis (Victor & Y akovlev,
1955), a condition involving severe and permanent impairment of recent memory that is now most
commonly a consequence of prolonged heavy drinking, will require continuing domiciliary care ( Sacks,

1985). While nursing homes and hospitals, mental ones especially, are commonly utilized for this
purpose, their appropriateness is open to question and their cost is frequently prohibitive. Hospice care
for individuals with AIDS may be viewed as a special instance of a creative and humane innovation in
supportive living for some persons who have also had serious drug problems. The provision of low-cost
supportive living arrangements of adequate scope and variety is an important agenda item for the future
in many medical, legal and social jurisdictions.

SETTING


Specialized treatment settings


A setting is a location in which treatment for alcohol or drug problems occurs. Such treatment
traditionally takes place in specialized treatment settings that may conveniently be categorised as inpatient,
residential, intermediate and outpatient settings. Inpatient settings are located in hospitals. Residential
settings involve 24-hour habitation but in other than a hospital facility. Outpatient settings host
treatments that are provided on an ambulatory basis, with the individual who is being treated coming to
the treatment setting on a regular basis, usually for brief periods (e.g. one to three hours per week).
Intermediate settings also host individuals who are living elsewhere and come regularly for treatment, but
for longer periods of time (e.g. four hours per day or more). The classic day programme is an example
of an intermediate setting.


Although seemingly straightforward, settings of treatment have in recent years generated considerable
controversy, especially in North America. To begin with, the custom has been to speak of inpatient,
residential, outpatient and intermediate treatments rather than settings. In the past, there was some
justification for this since the treatment provided in different settings seemed to be substantially the same
(Glaser, Greenberg, & Barrett, 1978). Now, however, there are many different treatments (see above)
being provided in a variety of settings. Since the appropriate setting for the treatment of a particular
individual may be governed by different determinants than the appropriate treatment for that individual,
a highly flexible approach in which any modality of treatment can be delivered in any setting might be
ideal. In any case, the development of the field has rendered such phrases as "inpatient treatment" and
"outpatient treatment" misnomers. Independent descriptors of modalities and settings are clearly required
now.


A related aspect of the controversy has been a dispute about whether specific stages of treatment should
be inextricably linked to particular settings, such as detoxification to inpatient settings, or the initiation
of all treatment for serious problems to residential settings. For purposes of this communication, the fact
that actual practice is variable, i.e. not all detoxification occurs in inpatient settings and not all episodes
of treatment for those with serious problems are initiated in residential settings, requires that setting be
considered separately as a descriptor.


A third aspect of the controversy has been the result of the differential costs of various settings, with
treatment in inpatient and residential settings being much more costly than in intermediate or outpatient
settings. Due to cost concerns, intense attention has been paid to determining the appropriate setting for
treatment (or the appropriate "level of care"). There is evidence that those who provide care, especially
for profit, tend to favour more expensive settings (Hansen & Ernrick, 1983). Those who reimburse
treatment providers tend to favour less expensive settings and have introduced various mechanisms to
assure that they are used. Such mechanisms include legally mandated independent assessment prior to
treatment (as in the state of Minnesota), the development of elaborate criteria for placement in the
appropriate level of care (such as the Cleveland criteria [Hoffmann, Halikas & Mee-Lee, 1987]) and the
introduction of intense scrutiny by payers of all treatment decisions, called in this context "managed care"


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 15


(Korcok, 1988; Havens, 1991). Once again, the variability of practice both in North America and
elsewhere renders cogent the use of setting as a descriptor of treatment.


**Other** settings


Even in North America, and to a greater extent elsewhere, treatment does not occur only in specialized
treatment settings. Rather it occurs in other settings as well. These are highly variable and include health
care settings (especially the offices of general medical practitioners), prisons or other criminal justice
settings, workplace settings, educational settings, religious settings and so forth. Indeed, treatment in
many parts of the world occurs in the home. What occurs in these settings is not merely a variant of
normal social intercourse but formal treatment for alcohol and drug problems that is recognised as such
by those who provide it and by those who receive it, that is, treatment defmed in the sense of the first
meeting of this project in Moscow (WHO, 1991 ). This point is emphasised since it could be argued that
what is done in the ordinary course of operations in a religious setting, is treatment in the sense that it is
therapeutic. Whether this is the case or not, formal treatment of the usual kind is carried out in these
settings and consequently it is reasonable that they be included in the descriptive scheme.


Although it is not the only example, the practices of Alcoholics Anonymous may be instanced in this
regard According to recent estimates there are more than a million AA members meeting in some 76 000
groups in 92 colUltries (Leach, 1973; Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, 1987). Thus it is perhaps
not surprising that AA meetings are held in a great variety of settings though in specialized treatment
settings and other settings though more commonly in the latter. While AA demurs at describing itself as
a treatment, it meets most defmitions of the term ( Tobin, 1992) and certainly meets the one that is
operative for this document.


**TARGET**


Treatments for alcohol and drug problems have differing targets. They are not all intended to deal with
the same kinds of alcohol or drug problems or with the same kinds or numbers of individuals. Indeed,
certain treatments are not directed primarily, or even at all, at the individual with the alcohol or drug
problem. Family or marital therapies of varying kinds generally include the individual with the problem
but are primarily directed at the social unit of which he or she is a part. Unilateral family therapy (Thomas
et al., 1987) targets the spouse of the individual with problems. Increasing attention is being devoted,
especially in the USA, to interventions for the children of such an individual (Woititz, 1983; West &
Prinz, 1987).


Where the individual with alcohol or drug problems is the primary target of treatment, many treatments
are claimed to be appropriate for all such persons, irrespective of their individual characteristics or their
drug of choice. Others limit themselves to persons with specific characteristics and/or problems with
specific substances. The Institute of Medicine report (Institute of Medicine, 1990) devotes four full
chapters to a consideration of treatments that are directed at the liDique needs of "special populations",
including those that are defmed by structural characteristics (e.g. women, adolescents, the elderly,


WHOfPSAf93.10
page 16


American Indians, etc.) and those defmed by functional characteristics (drinking drivers, so-called "dual
diagnosis" psychiatric patients, homeless persons, college students, etc.).


Assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, there is no evidence that any particular treatment is effective
for all persons with alcohol or drug problems (Institute of Medicine, 1990 ). Rather, particular treatments
are effective for subsets of the larger population and identifying the salient features of these subsets should
be a principal focus of research. The overall goal is to improve the efficacy and efficiency of treatment
by matching individuals with specific characteristics to treatments that are highly likely to facilitate
satisfactory results for them (Institute of Medicine, 1990).


In order to account for the variations among treatments as to their targets, three subcategories of this
descriptor are proposed. One is the specific substance that is being targeted. A second is the intended
interactive unit with which the therapist deals, whether that unit is an individual, a couple, a group, a
family, a social network, a community, a population or another interactive unit. The third subcategory
specifies the particular characteristics of the interactive unit that identify it as the target of the treatment.
Thus, for psychoanalytically-oriented individual psychotherapy, the interactive unit is an individual and
the particular characteristics might include insightfulness and verbal fluency. For a women's group, the
interactive unit is the group and the characteristic that is relevant is the sex of the participants. For these
two examples of treatments specific substances are not targeted, but in other treatments they may be.
Narcotic antagonist therapy, for example, is targeted specifically at opiates, while drugs such as disulfrram
and carbamide are targeted at alcohol.


Treatments that are similar in modality but different in terms of target will need to be separately described.
For example, one of the treatment methods investigated in the famous Winter VA Hospital study
(Wallerstein, 1956; Wallerstein, 1957) was group hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy is more frequently
conducted with individuals as targets. Hence individual hypnotherapy and group hypnotherapy would
need to be described separately. It is likely that variation in target will be accompanied by variation in
other descriptors, such as strategy. One of the generic advantages of group therapies over individual
therapies comes into play when the therapist(s) and the group members have widely differing
backgrounds, a not uncommon occurrence in the treatment of persons using illegal drugs such as heroin.
Members of the group will commonly assume a therapeutic stance with respect to one another, lessening
to some extent the adverse effect of therapist-group member differences. Such a group would differ from
individual therapy not only in terms of target but also in terms of strategy.


**PROVIDER**


As targets of treatments differ, so do the attributes of those providing it. "There are now many persons
with differing backgrounds who are providing treatment" (Institute of Medicine, 1990). Differences
between providers may conveniently be described in terms of training and other requirements.


WHO/PSN93.10

page 17


Training


Although not without their importance, degrees and licences that are relevant to practice in the alcohol and
drug field are not widely distributed on a global basis. Even in a country with a strong emphasis upon
credential like the USA, the bulk of staff who provide treatment - the alcohol and drug counsellors - are
at present neither degreed nor licensed. Many of these personnel, however, have received a form of
training: their own treatment experience. Some programmes view this experience as a necessary and even
a sufficient qualification for success in the role of counsellor. In traditional societies, the shaman,
medicine man or other traditional healer receives extensive training, though of another kind. Professional
therapists in Western societies tend to be trained in one of several disciplines, in particular medicine,
psychology and social work. Thus the training background of the provider, rather than the degrees or
licenses that he or she may have earned, would seem to be the relevant descriptive variable.


Special characteristics


Beyond this, however, there may be specific personal characteristics that render a given individual more
effective in providing a particular kind of treatment. For example, in a series of studies of psychotherapy,
those who achieved accurate empathic understanding of the patient, manifested non-possessive warmth
and projected genuineness or authenticity in the therapeutic situation produced significantly better results
(Truax & Wargo, 1966~ Carkhuff, 1968). A supervisor of individuals providing "primary care", a
generalized, long-term supportive activity similar to case management, described some 15 personal
characteristics that he felt were critical attributes for such work (Pearlman, 1984). In psychoanalytic
treatment, the completion of a personal analysis is felt to render the individual relatively free of intrapsychic conflict and hence to be crucial to the ability to conduct psychoanalysis effectively.


For other treatments, no particular personal characteristics have been felt to be especially relevant. Even
in treatments where the relevance of some characteristics is assumed, an empirical demonstration of
relevance is often lacking. From a descriptive standpoint the assumption of relevance should be sufficient
for the present. Finally, it should be noted that there has been much discussion of the relevance of
therapist characteristics to the treatment of particular kinds of individuals (Razin, 1971; McLachlan,

1972~ McLachlan, 1974~ Glaser, 1980; Institute of Medicine, 1990). While this may prove to be a fruitful
avenue of exploration and research and underscores the practical utility of specifying therapist
characteristics, it is primarily an issue for treatment matching.


TIME FRAME


Treatments are highly variable in terms of their time requirements. A single session of brief intervention
may last only five to 20 minutes, while a single session of marathon group therapy may last 36 hours or
more. If one considers the full course of therapy, the range is again from five to 20 minutes for brief intervention, to several years for psychoanalytic therapy and perhaps to a lifetime for "primary care" (Glaser,
1984 ). Thus usual time per session and usual time per complete course of therapy are useful descriptors
of treatment.


WHO/PSA/93 .10
page 18


EFFICACY


A decision has been taken to include the totality of treatment responses in the mapping process to be
undertaken as a result of this exercise, irrespective of their demonstrated efficacy or lack thereof. It is
nevertheless quite reasonable to include some information on efficacy as a descriptor. Two elements are
proposed One has to do with the level or levels of evidence of efficacy that have been developed for the
treatment being described. The other is an estimate, based on existing evidence, of what can be concluded
about its efficacy.


Types of evidence


It is proposed that three levels of evidence of efficacy be used as subcategories. The first is anecdotal
evidence. Unless a given treatment has never been implemented, there is likely to be anecdotal evidence
regarding its efficacy. The second level of efficacy is evidence from outcome studies. At this level, the
treatment has not only been implemented but a systematic study of the outcome of the treatment, at other
has been conducted, sometimes at the end of treatment, at other times after. It is generally appreciated that
a positive result following the delivery of a treatment, while consistent with treatment efficacy, does not
demonstrate it conclusively. Intercurrent but non-treatment factors - a marriage, a divorce, a death, the
loss of a job, the maturation or aging of the individual, so-called "spontaneous remission" of the problem
(Institute of Medicine, 1990) and so forth- may have produced the result. Nevertheless, a high proportion
of positive results following treatment is encouraging, especially if the whole population entering
treatment has been studied.


A third level of evidence of efficacy is more conclusive. Two equivalent groups are involved in this sort
of efficacy determination, one of which receives treatment while the other does not. If the group that
receives treatment does significantly better than the group that does not, important evidence of the efficacy
of the treatment has been provided. Since the two groups are best equalized by a process of random
assignment and since the purpose of this manoeuvre is to control for variations in outcome that could be
due to differences between the groups rather than to the effects of treatment (e.g. one of the groups having
a higher incidence than the other of the non-treatment factors cited above, this kind of study is often called
a randomized controlled trial (RCT). There are problems in demonstrating efficacy even with RCTs
(Institute of Medicine, 1990), but they do constitute a significant increment in validity of proof of efficacy.
Thus the third level of the proposed descriptor of efficacy is evidence from randomized controlled trials.


As an illustration of how these subcategories may be useful in describing the efficacy of a treatment, the
example of disulfiram (An tab use) may be cited. The drug has been in clinical use since 1948 and much
anecdotal evidence regarding its efficacy exists. A number of outcome studies have been carried out, as
well as one large-scale randomized controlled trial (Fuller et al., 1986). Thus, one would conclude that
all three levels of evidence are available for disulfiram treatment.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 19


Conclusions from evidence


The second element of this descriptor has to do with what may reasonably be concluded from those tests
of efficacy that have been carried out. Subcategories of positive, negative and inconclusive are proposed.
This admittedly requires a judgment call since it involves weighing the available evidence. Some
guidelines can be proposed, such as giving greater weight to outcome studies than to anecdotal evidence
and giving greater weight to randomized controlled trials than to outcome studies. Obviously, though, the
level of confidence that can be entrusted to this subcategoty is limited. Nevertheless, it is included because
of its potential utility. One might, for example, wish to look at the kinds of modalities that are felt to have
positive evidence of efficacy.


While much positive anecdotal evidence for the its efficacy of disulfiram (Antabuse) exists, results from
outcome studies have been mixed and the results from the single large randomized controlled trial were
essentially negative. Employing the weighing scheme proposed above, one might well conclude that, the
evidence on the efficacy of disulfiram is negative. Even if valid, such a conclusion would not imply that
disulfiram, or any other particular treatment, should be avoided under all circumstances. No single study
can presume to be definitive. Ideally, multiple RCTs will be carried out for each modality of treatment
to fully test it under differing conditions, with different populations, and so forth. Furthermore, most
efficacy studies to date are designed to test whether a given treatment is useful for all persons with alcohol
problems. That a treatment is not useful for all persons does not exclude the possibility that it may be
useful for some persons. Indeed, this was one of the stronger suggestions that came out of the large
controlled trial on disulfiram treatment (Fuller et al., 1986).


Note that the manner in which this descriptor is constructed deliberately limits evidence of efficacy that
is not derived from carefully designed, objective testing. That a particular treatment has been in use for
a long time, or that many persons prominent in the treatment field (or other fields) have a strong
conviction of its usefulness or feel that they themselves have been helped by it, is a kind of endorsement
that, is to be viewed with caution. In the final analysis, efficacy is not best judged by popularity. To go
beyond testimonials reasonably requires evidence derived from more valid techniques. Moreover, it is
clearly the obligation of the proponents of a treatment to assure that such evidence is brought forward.
Any treatment should be presumed to be ineffective and potentially hazardous until proven otherwise.


COST


The cost of treatment for alcohol and drug problems in monetary terms varies from a negligible cost to
a very high cost indeed. In the former categoty are mutual help groups and some traditional methods of
treatment; in the latter categoty are treatments in hospital settings and in some residential settings. It is
probably best to describe both the cost per session of treatment and the cost per course of treatment. A
treatment with high sessional costs but a short course might cost less than a treatment with low sessional
costs but a prolonged course. For example, it has been argued that initiating treatment with a 28-day
hospital stay is defensible in terms of cost because it may result in a significantly shorter course of
treatment when compared with treatment that is provided only on an outpatient basis.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 20


The global nature of the mapping attempt in this study may unduly complicate reference to any absolute
standard of cost. A categorical approach (negligible cost, minimal cost, moderate cost, high cost) may
prove to be more practical. The baseline reference should logically be the local area in which the modality
being described exists, since it is in terms of relative price in that area that the cost of treatment is an
operative factor in treatment selection. If the same modality of treatment has significantly different costs
in different countries or in different locations in the same country, a notation to this effect should be made.


AVAILABILITY


As is the case with the availability of alcohol and drugs themselves, the availability of treatment for
alcohol and drug problems is highly variable and is affected by many factors. Among these are the
geographical distribution of the treatments, the supply of qualified staff, the proximity of programmes to
routes of transportation and the costs of the treatment (high costs effectively excluding persons with
limited resources). While it would be possible to categorize the factors that may limit availability, it is
perhaps more practical simply to categorize availability itself.


Categories of available but limited, moderately available and widely available are suggested. A category
of not available would be logically satisfactory but is superfluous since a modality that is not available
should not be described. Once again, the point of reference has to be the local area that is being mapped.
However, if the same modality is differentially available in particular areas or countries, a notation should
be made to that effect. Research on availability, while limited, has produced some interesting results. For
example, in a particular state of the USA it was shown that there was no correlation between the locations
of alcohol treatment programmes and the prevalence of alcohol problems (Glaser & Greenberg, 1975).
Subsequent examination found a similar relationship for the USA as a whole (Institute of Medicine, 1990).


UTILIZATION


Whether or not a programme is utilized is contingent upon its availability but is also influenced by many
other factors. Simply because a programme is available does not ensure that it will be utilized. Nor does
the fact that a programme's efficacy has been demonstrated, or that it has not been demonstrated, seem
necessarily to be related to utilization. Like other consumer products, treatments may be fashionable or
otherwise (Tourney, 1967). In the USA, a deciding factor of fashionability is the endorsement of a
treatment by celebrities who have undertaken it. Many of the other factors remain to be still determined.


It is tempting to utilize a point prevalence figure to categorize treatment utilization, i.e. how many
individuals are being treated at a particular point in time, but such a figure would fail to take into account
the wide fluctuations in treatment programme census that occur over time ( Glaser, 197 4 ). The number
of persons utilizing a treatment over a more extended period of time would approach somewhat more
closely a valid measure of utilization. However, obtaining a non-duplicated count of individuals is
technically complicated by the problem of multiple episodes of service that are provided to specific
individuals. Since any episode of service represents utilization of a treatment, whether or not an individual
has used the service previously in the same time period, the number of episodes of service per year has


WHO/PSN93 .1 0

page 21


been selected as the most reasonable form for this descriptor, with admittedly arbitrary numerical values
attached to the several categories (e.g. 20, 50, 100 episodes of service per year, and so forth). With
increasing experience in the documentation of availability, these categories will be adjusted in future.


ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS


The characteristics of the group of organizations that provide treatment are not fixed but may vary greatly
over time (Y ahr, 1988). Because it is important to know how such changes may affect other descriptors
of treatment, such as utilization and efficacy, organizational characteristics are included here as a major
descriptor. In addition, if governmental policy is to play some role in determining the pattern of service
to be provided, it is important to understand the organizational characteristics of the service delivery
system. In many countries the flexibility of different kinds of organizations with respect to governmental
regulation varies. For example, programmes in the private sector are generally less amenable to such
regulation than programmes in the public sector.


Two organizational descriptors are suggested. One has to do with the administrative auspices under which
the treatment programme operates, that is, whether it is a free-standing entity, or whether it operates within
the framework of another organization such as a mental health agency. The other descriptor has to do with
the source of funds, that is, whether the funds are primarily derived from public or private sources, or
whether they are a mixture of both.


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS


To assist in the task of mapping the treatment response to alcohol and drug problems, l2 descriptors are
proposed. They are modality, philosophy, stage specificity, setting, target, provider, time frame, efficacy,
cost, availability, utilization and organizational characteristics. Each descriptor is discussed, subcategories
are suggested and examples are provided. An advantage to this approach is that each descriptor can be
utilized as an element in an interactive database, permitting the information gathered to be analyzed in a
variety of ways. For example, one could look at all low-cost treatments, or at all treatments with evidence
of efficacy from controlled trials, or at both simultaneously, or at any combination of the descriptor
variables. This could also be done for a given geographic area, or (presuming that consistent descriptors
are collected at regular intervals) to map changes in treatment over time. This does not exhaust the
multiple possibilities that are raised by carrying out the mapping of treatment in this way.


The recommendations in this chapter should be viewed as preliminary. Modifications are particularly in
order in terms of content. The overall strategy of utilizing a limited series of specific descriptors may
survive if it proves to be useful. The goal is to arrive at objective, quantitative criteria for each descriptor
and subcategory. Time and experience, especially the experience of using this or a modified set of descriptors to map what exists, will help to improve the approach. Then it will be possible to know what exists
in terms of treatment, which is a crucial step toward improved treatment for alcohol and drug problems.


For convenience of reference and discussion, the proposed scheme of descriptors is presented in an outline
form in the Appendix to this chapter.

11. FACTORS INFLUENCING TREATMENT


A broad range of social and structural extra-treatment factors influences the process, outcome and
organization of treatment for drug and alcohol problems. This set of complex and interacting variables has
been called the "social ecology of treatment" (Room, 1980; Weisner, 1987). The literature describing this
social ecology and the number of countries it represents is growing. However, data are still limited, and not
comparable between different countries and are often only anecdotal. In addition, this literature is not
applicable for drugs and alcohol. For example, the cross-cultural research on laws regarding treatment is
more extensive for the drug field, while research on patterns of use and problems is more comprehensive for
alcohol. This review describes the variety of factors influencing treatment, drawing on examples from around
the world Where possible, it indicates the specific ways in which these factors affect treatment. For the most
part, however, research that would pinpoint these influences is limited and firm conclusions cannot be drawn.


Alcohol and other drugs are a major concern in countries throughout the world. The World Health
Organization reports on these topics produced in the 1980s attest to the rise in importance of this concern
and the creation of Programme on Substance Abuse (PSA) in 1990 re-emphasized that fact. The focus on
drug and alcohol use has been accompanied by an increase in the response to these problems, including a
dramatic expansion of treatment capabilities in many countries. It is not just the tremendous growth in
medical and therapeutic knowledge that has influenced treatment; if it were, treatment would be more
consistent from country to country. Many different influences have contributed to the growth of treatment
and to the forms it takes in different societies.


Factors influencing the treatment of substance abuse are discussed here under five major headings: the social
and cultural context of substance abuse in the community; the political and economic context of treatment
systems; characteristics of treatment systems; the availability of treatment and means of entry; and the larger
context of handling substance abuse problems in the community.


SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN THE
COMMUNITY


An early WHO report emphasizes the importance of the social and cultural context in determining the
definition of drug and alcohol problems, as well as the response to those problems. "Of all the factors
influencing action, the most powerful is the sheer diversity of sociocultural determinants. The differences
between groups of countries and even between countries within the same region cannot be overemphasized.
Any plan of action which fails to take account of this diversity cannot hope to meet the real needs of
particular populations" (WHO, 1983).


In addition, Shaw et al., ( 1978) argue that "the nature and extent of the response to a problem is determined
by how the problem is perceived and how prevalent it is estimated to be". The social and cultural factors
which affect alcohol and drug treatment are reviewed here in terms of the sociodemographic characteristics
of the community and related patterns of use and levels of problems, the availability of alcohol and drugs,
attitudes to alcohol and drug use, types of problems and populations of concern and the extent of combined
alcohol and drug problems in the community.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 32


Sociodemographic characteristics of the community and related patterns of use and levels of problems


Although much remains to be learned, the cross-cultural research on drinking and drug use patterns is
expanding and shows very different patterns from society to society. Such differences have numerous
implications for treatment. Drug and alcohol use patterns, as well as types of drugs used within and across
countries, often affect the targeting of individuals for treatment. These patterns can place treatment in
different contexts, for example, making it fundamentally either therapeutic or a method of social control.
They can affect the decision of whether to include medical intervention as a large component of treatment.
In regard to alcoho~ countries such as Italy which have high daily consumption also have high levels of health
problems (i.e., cirrhosis) and their system of treatment is largely medically based. Conversely, countries with
"binge drinking" patterns, such as Finland and Mexico, have high levels of social problems and less
medically-oriented treatment. In regard to other drugs, countries such as Germany and Italy, where heroin
use is a primary, increasing problem (European Summary of Drug Abuse [ESDA], 1992), have a different
set of factors to consider in developing treatment strategies than countries such as Portugal, Poland and
Romania (ESDA, 1992) where inhalants are defined as the growing problem.


Gender, age and ethnicity often affect distribution of substance use within a country. For example, types of
drugs used often differ according to age of the users within and across countries. Glue sniffmg and the use
of inhalants in general often affect younger populations than does use of other drugs (Stewart & Casswell,
1992; ESDA, 1992). In some countries where heroin has been a major problem for many years, the first
couple of generations of the particular treatment population are growing older and posing concomitant
problems for treatment provision, such as the problems faced by their children (see for example, descriptions
of France, Sweden and the Netherlands in ESDA, 1991; and of the United States in Institute of Medicine,
1990a,b ). Age is an important predictor of heavy drinking and related problems in most countries, but the
distribution of problems by age differs from country to country. Several studies have described the different
drinking and drug use patterns of men and women and their variation from country to country. In Mexico
and Zambia, for example, women's drinking patterns differ from men's much more than is the case in
Scotland (Ritson, 1985; Haworth, Mwanalushi & Todd., 1981; Calderon, Campillo-Serrano & Suarez, 1981).
There is some indication that in many European countries, women misuse licit drugs such as sedatives in
higher proportions than men do (ESDA, 1992).


Understanding ethnic and racial diversity is also crucial in this context. For example, the Maori and nonMaori populations in New Zealand (Stewart & Casswell in Klingemann et al., 1992), the Native American,
Black, Hispanic and White populations in the USA (Caetano, 1993; Herd, 1991), and Muslim and Christian
populations in Nigeria (Odejide et al., 1992) have been found to have significant differences in drinking and
drug use patterns and distribution of problems. China's many different nationalities also present a wide range
of prevalence rates of alcohol abuse (Y ani, 1992). The republics of the former Yugoslavia present another
example of different population groups with very different use patterns and attitudes (Lang & Sradar, 1992).
In countries such as India the proportion of the population drinking at all or drinking large amounts is very
small, yet the problem rates of this group may be extremely high.


The distribution of drug patterns by ethnicity has not been studied to the same extent as patterns of alcohol
use. However, the recent ESDA study (1992) found higher prevalence of drug abuse in ethnic minority
groups (such as gypsy groups in Hungmy) and immigrant groups, as well as in groups representing the lower
socioeconomic status populations of the countries studied. Stewart & Casswell, 1992 compare the use of


WHO/PSA/93.1 0

page 33


certain drugs in Maori and non-Maori populations in New Zealand. Different ethnic groups within the same
countiyoften report problematic alcohol and drug use at different ages (Caetano, 1993; Herd, 1991).


Thus, age, gender and ethnic differences in drug and alcohol use become important factors in mapping the
treatment response to those problems. For example, there is a strong belief in the USA that special
programmes are needed for women, for Blacks and for Hispanics in order to attract them to treatment and
to improve outcome rates. However, this assumption has not been well-evaluated (Institute of Medicine,

1990a) and at the same time, when programmes are targeted at certain disenfranchised groups, they run the
risk of serving a social control rather than treatment function. Drug treatment programmes targeting Black
populations in the USA and alcohol programmes for Maori populations in New Zealand have been discussed
in this light (Weisner & Room, 1984; Stewart and Casswell, 1992).


Availability of drugs and alcohol within communities


The availability of drugs and alcohol may be associated with the level of treatment need and types of services.
Availability of a substance is determined by all the interacting factors that make it easily accessible to
consumers, including price and proximity. In addition, the degree of availability is not directly related to legal
status. While use of many types of drugs is not legal in most countries, availability of various ·drugs
fluctuates over time. For example, drug epidemics in the USA have been attributed to availability (Institute
of Medicine, 1990b). For alcohol, the relationship between availability and illegal production has been
discussed in relation to the former USSR (lvanets et al., 1992) and other countries. Researchers in Hungruy,
Nigeria and Mexico have suggested that increased availability also indicates treatment need (Elekes, 1992;
Ritson, 1985). Studies in Alaska and ofNative American drinking in the USA as a whole have demonstrated
lower problem levels and corresponding need for treatment when availability is reduced. That philosophy
constitutes the theoretical underpinning of anti-drug policy in the USA in recent years with at least as strong
a focus on interdiction as on treatment. Reports from India and Zimbabwe suggest that the existence of high
consumption levels of liquor from unregulated breweries and home brew may lead to acceleration of the
negative health effects of drinking. This would affect the type of treatment required, indicating the need for
a larger focus on medical intervention in the content of treatment.


Community attitudes to drug and alcohol use and problems


Attitudes to drug and alcohol use vruy among cultures as much as do use patterns. A 1962 WHO survey of
drug legislation found that "in some countries severe penalties for addiction were considered appropriate
whereas in others a 'habit' was considered 'normal"' (in Porter, Arif & Curran, 1986). Many cultures have
different expectations about use for men and women (see discussion of Mexico and Zambia in Ritson, 1985)
and this affects treatment provision as well. The type of substance most popularly used may also affect
attitudes. Regionalism, with different areas of a countiy being relatively "wet" or "dry" or having higher or
lower rates of illicit drug use may also be a factor. This typically reflects both use patterns and other aspects
oflocal culture (Hilton, 1991).


The degree of tolerance of high levels of alcohol consumption and drug use also varies from one society to
another. As use patterns vruy by population group, the variation is more dramatic where illicit drugs and high
levels of alcohol consumption are concerned. Drug use and drunkenness, for example, are tolerated for men
much more than for women in some cultures. This is likely to affect which persons are noticed for treatment


WHOIPSA/93.10
page 34


as well as the stage of problem at which they are targeted When examining treatment systems, it is important
to take into consideration overall public cultural attitudes toward use patterns, as well as diversity within
cultures. In the USA, for example, there has been criticism of treatment systems and strategies that do not
reflect this diversity. Some researchers have found insensitivity to diversity to be a reason for low treatment
outcome rates for minority groups in the population.


A complicating factor is that attitudes often differ about use of alcohol as opposed to use of other drugs. In
many countries, although drug use is illegal, alcohol use is legal and widely advertised and alcohol production
is a major industry. This is sometimes a reflection of the attitudes of the populace, but it also influences these
attitudes. The often huge differences in social acceptance of alcohol and other drugs make it a complex
matter to treat both types of substance problems within the same agency or to treat individuals with both
types of problems.


Community attitudes to drug and alcohol use directly affect when, why and which individuals go to treatment.
Communities do or do not support social policy that targets problems for treatment depending on their degree
of concern about alcohol and/or drugs. These community attitudes also affect the context of the problem for
clients within which therapists and other personnel must work When attitudes to drug and alcohol use are
not mainstream in a culture or not consistent across the different groups within a society, treatment strategies
are required to operate in a more heterogeneous context. Attitudes to drug and alcohol use are also related
to attitudes to treatment. For example, treatment programmes within a community that accepts treatment as
a resolution of its alcohol related problems have a different set of tasks than do treatment programmes in
communities that support a social control/criminal justice solution to those problems.


Types of problems of concern to the community


The extent and type of drug and alcohol problems also vary across societies and the range of behaviours
defined as such in turn affects the extent and type of services. As described above, drug "epidemics" and the
type of drug of concern affect the treatment capacity and type of treatment. AIDS is an example of a problem
that has shifted concern to drugs associated with the use of needles. The study ofDavies and Walsh (1983)
showed that different levels of different types of problems affected the treatment response across countries.
A WHO Alcohol and Media study (1983) pointed out that "in countries with a long history of alcohol
problems the medical consequences of heavy drinking may be an important message for treatment agencies
to disseminate but in developing countries more immediate concerns such as the link between alcohol and job
loss may have greater impact."


At the same time, when similar problems exist across societies, they are not always considered of equal
importance. The types of problems that concern communities vary greatly and affect the characteristics of
treatment. In fact, it has been community-based social movements that have motivated changes in social
policy either directly or indirectly. The issue of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs provides an
illustration. In the space of a few years, drunk (and more recently "drugged") driving went from being a
problem that was largely ignored or handled within the criminal justice system to one that has overwhelmed
the treatment system with large number of clients (Walsh, 1982; Weisner, 1987). This growing concern
resulted in the development of diversion programmes and the referral to both drug and alcohol treatment of
many individuals who otherwise would not have gone for treatment.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 35


AIDS is a very dramatic example of a problem which, over time and to different extent in different societies,
has become associated with drug and alcohol use. As this problem has emerged and its relationship with
substance use has been understood, it has affected treatment systems directly, both by heightening awareness
of the "problem" of substance use and by increasing the population looking to these treatment programmes
for help and resources. The connection between substance abuse and AIDS has affected both the designation
of populations targeted for treatment and the process of treatment. This has been the case in such countries
as the USA, Uganda and Brazil (9th Brazilian conference, 1991; Gossop & Grant (1991) found in their study
of methadone programmes. (in the Netherlands, Thailand, France, Australia, Canada and Britain) that
methadone programmes and methadone use as a treatment strategy were increasing in most countries studied
as concern over AIDS grew and as a philosophy of harm reduction developed.


The place of drug and alcohol problems in the hierarchy of social and health problems in a community also
affects treatment. There is some evidence that more resources for treatment are forthcoming when alcohol
and drugs are considered more important than other social problems (e.g. the infusion of treatment funds in
the USA during the recent "drug war"). Nowhere is the rank of drug and alcohol problems static in relation
to other problems. At various points in the history of various countries, problems related to homelessness,
crime, education and poverty, have had more or less political and cultural importance than alcohol or drugs.
Alcohol and drug problems themselves shift over time in relation to each other, thus affecting the resources
and monitoring of treatment as Glaser ( 1978) has described.


Populations of concernto the community


The diversity of populations defmed as having drug or alcohol problems affects the extent and type of
services as well as the characteristics of treatment. Often one population group is found to have, or is thought
to have, a higher prevalence of these problems. Sometimes this status endures and sometimes the designation
of problem groups changes over time. It has been argued for example, that the problem of public
drunkenness is really a focus on the status of specific population groups in many countries. W alsh (1982)
found that public drunkenness is determined as much by "a person's social, ethnic and economic background
as on the amount of alcohol that he has consumed". In some countries, this population was often the
dominant treatment group in the past. The Maori in New Zealand have been considered by government
policy makers as being at high risk for alcohol and drug abuse (Stewart & Casswell, 1992). More specifically
related to drugs, children living in slum conditions in Brazil who use inhalants (9th Brazilian conference,
1991) are a newly targeted group. Pregnant women using drugs such as cocaine are a new focus in the USA.
These designations of populations with problems affect the organization, characteristics and strategies of
treatment. The lack of expandable resources may often have an overall impact on the treatment system by
requiring reallocation of limited resources for the provision of specifically tailored services. Depending on
attitudes toward these populations, different types of services may be developed, such as the Employee
Assistance Programmes and programmes for pregnant drug users in the USA and programmes designed for
the Maori in New Zealand.


When target populaiions shift over time, the treatment response often changes as well. As concern over drug
use related to AIDS and concern over the broadening range of populations using cocaine and related drugs
has increased in many countries, drug services have been transformed. And as the target population has
changed in many countries from one of public inebriates to one ofhidden alcoholics, and problem drinkers


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 36


to problem drinkers, alcohol services have changed as well. A more therapeutic constellation of services has
evolved, replacing the "practical needs" approach of public inebriate services.


Level of combined alcohol and drug problems


The prevalence of high levels of drug and alcohol use in a society and the balance between the two affects
treattnent programmes and strategies as well as designation of the treatment population. Drug and alcohol
treattnent populations have traditionally come from different population groups. A change in the proportion
of alcohol abuse clients to drug abuse clients in treatment thus can have the effect of changing the
characteristics of the treatment population. Changes in the balance of problems between drugs and alcohol
occur over time in a community. In fact, significant changes have occurred worldwide in this balance during
the past decade. A current widely adopted concept is one of overlapping alcohol and drug problems.
Epidemiologic data point to a high prevalence of combined drug and alcohol use and problems in individuals
(Hubbard, 1990; Norton & Noble, 1987; Clayton, 1986), although data are limited across countries.


These changes in the prevalence of use of alcohol compared with use of other drugs or changes in levels of
combined use have potentially dramatic effects on the structure and content of treatment (Glaser, 1978).
Because of the high prevalence of combined alcohol and drug use and abuse, treatment systems and individual
programmes that historically were separate have been merging (see country reports in Klingemann, Takala
& Hunt, 1992). The two treattnent systems have very different histories, target populations, treatment
ideologies and treattnent strategies. Although this merging is occurring without benefit of evaluated
treatment strategies for those who abuse both alcohol and other drugs, programmes are accommodating the
new treattnent populations. The treatment field faces the necessity of developing new treatment approaches
and methods (Hubbard, 1990; Weisner, 1990).


THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT OF ALCOHOL AND
DRUG TREATMENT


Little attention has been paid by clinicians to the larger political and economic context in which treatment
systems exist This context includes the source of financing of services, laws regarding drug and alcohol use
and treattnent, the status of public health within a society, the overall wealth and resources of a country and
its stage of development It also includes the role of drug and alcohol production and industries in a society,
such as the importance of viticulture and wine production to the economy.


Financing of treatment


Provision of treatment is largely dependent upon available financial resources. The overall development and
wealth of a country affect specific treatments as well as the range of treatment available. Regarding, for
example, drug detoxification, the survey of countries by Porter, Arif & Curran, (1986) found: "The type of
withdrawal method used depends both on overall country policies and available pharmaceuticals. In some
countries, it may not be possible for treatment to go beyond detoxification." However, because of the
differing costs of treatments, the precise relationship between the amount of resources and extent of services
is not as clear as might be expected Qnstitute of Medicine, 1990 a,b ). Inpatient clinical services are expensive
and serve fewer patients than non-medical residential programmes and non-hospital-based outpatient


WHO/PSA/93.1 0

page 37


programmes. The utilization/cost ratios for social model programmes in the USA contrast dramatically with
those for regular clinical services. There is some evidence that outcome rates of non-medical programmes
might not vary significantly from those of clinical services, yet since their cost is much less they can provide
services to much larger numbers of individuals.


In addition to overall fmancing levels, the modes of fmancing have important effects both on access to and
on the substance of drug and alcohol treatment. Public rather than private funding often increases the
likelihood of a planned and monitored system of services. A tremendous variety of sources of and approaches
to treatment financing exists across countries (Klingemann, Takala & Hunt, 1992). In a few countries,
services are primarily private and available for those who can pay. In many others, the majority of services
are publicly funded and are not based on ability to pay (e.g. Canada, Britain, the former USSR). In others,
such as Brazil and the USA, there is a mixture of public and private services. A mixed public/private system,
such as that found in the USA, can produce unevenness in the types of programme available to public and
private clientele (Y ahr, 1983 ). In addition, in spite of the extensive and specialized treatment establishment
in the USA, the urban/rural distribution of services is uneven, as is the distribution of services by state in
regard to statistics on per capita consumption and rates of cirrhosis (Institute of Medicine, 1990 a,b; Weisner
and Morgan, 1992). The same pattern may be found for the distribution of drug services as well (Institute
ofMedicine, 1990b). A 1973 WHO study found this dilemma not as extreme in smaller countries (Ozarin,
1973 ), but this has not been well examined across a range of countries in recent years.


The extent to which services are centrally planned rather than a product of market forces often affects their
stability, continuity and comprehensiveness. State fmancing and planning increases the probability that
services will be based on a public health model that targets and plans interventions for the range of
populations with alcohol and drug problems. The basis of fmancing also affects the degree to which the
individual provider takes a public health-oriented or an individual-oriented approach (WHO London Family
Health Meeting, 1984).


Laws regarding drug and alcohol use


A society's laws regarding use of drugs and alcohol (including age restrictions), the extent of other types of
laws related to alcohol and drugs (e.g. the extent oflegal control and interdiction, regulations on availability,
the extent and nature of" drug wars") and specific laws relating to drug or alcohol behaviours (e.g. driving
under the influence, selling drugs, public drunkenness) also affect treatment.


Countries differ greatly in terms of legal permissiveness about the use of alcohol and drugs both in general
and for specific populations. Even within countries the severity oflaws differs. In the case of alcohol, for
example, according to Odejide et al., 1992, any use of alcohol by a Muslim in northern Nigeria except for
medicinal purposes results in severe penalties. On the other hand, southern Nigeria has no penal legislation
against drinking. In regard to its effect on treatment, all Nigeria's substance abuse treatment programmes
are found in the south. Laws in countries affected by colonialism (e.g. New Zealand, as discussed by Stewart
& Casswell, 1992) may be in transition and reflect differing attitudes to alcohol use by indigenous
populations as these countries become more autonomous. Many countries have laws governing age of legal
use and situations where drinking may take place (see Makelii et al., 1981 and country reports in Klingemann,
Takala & Hunt, 1992). On the whole, laws regarding illicit drug use are much more comprehensive and
stringent than those relating to alcohol use. Some countries have laws regarding "addicts" (Porter, Arif &


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 38


Curran., 1986) and the range and severity of these laws differ. This can affect the treatment system in ways
not yet well understood.


Across countries, these laws change greatly over time in their focus, comprehensiveness and stringency. An
examination of the modem drug treatment system in the USA reveals several generations of programmes,
varying in focus and approach, each of which came into existence during one or several drug epidemics in
the present century (Institute of Medicine, 1990b; Weisner, 1990). At the current time, "wars" on drugs are
found in several countries and impact greatly the amount of overall resources for treatment as well as its
environment and focus.


The existence and severity of laws regarding drinking and drug use clearly affect the structure, environment
and process of treatment. Criminalization of specific drinking or drug related behaviours and the
establishment of referral procedures from the criminal justice system affect treatment. When other criminal
behaviours such as wife beating, child abuse or robbery become associated with drug or alcohol use, other
involuntary treatment populations may be created. The level of interdiction toward drug and alcohol
problems is important and the degree to which these problems are medicalized affects the characteristics of
treatment programmes.


Status of public health services in a society


The overall status of public health services, the regard in which they are held by government and the respect
they have from the populace affect the content and the characteristics of treatment. In addition, public and
official perceptions of the populations that utilize these services and the value of such services to the state
or society as a whole affect the treatment programmes offered. Many of the changes which treatment in
Poland has undergone over time have been related to the status of public health under different government
systems (Morawski, 1992). Examples from Hungary (Elekes, 1992) demonstrate how the regard for public
health in a country also often affects the amount of resources and the types of programmes available.


Role of alcohol and drug production and industries


Evidence abounds of the critical role played by the industries associated with the production and sale of
alcohol and drugs, both legal and illicit, in a society (Makelii et al., 1981). Lang (Lang & Sradar, 1992)
reports that in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, where vine growing and wine production have been
an important and integral part of the economy from at least 1288 to the present, " ... though there is no reliable
historical evidence, it seems that excessive drinking and alcoholism were less common and widespread before
the industrial production of alcoholic beverages than they are today." Especially in developing countries, the
choices to be made regarding revenue from such industries and public health needs are often difficult ones.
Ozarin's report of a study of nine European countries ( 1973) argued that societies have not often faced up
to the dilemma that this issue raises. This factor has not been researched as much in regard to drugs as in the
case of alcohol since drugs are most often illegal and their industries are also. As such, the role played by
illegal industries is unclear.


This extra treatment factor is important since, to the extent that both alcohol and drug production industries
have direct or indirect political influence, it can affect the balance between treatment and social control
institutions for the handling of problems, the issues of legality and their influence on defining treatment


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 39


populations. One international study (Makela et al., 1981) interpreted the expansion of alcohol treatment
systems in some countries a kind of societal alibi for dismantling controls over alcohol industries.


**CHARACTERISTICS OF TREATMENT SYSTEMS**


A series offactors intrinsic to the system itself bear upon the description of drug and alcohol treatment. They
include historical, organizational and ideological characteristics.


**Background of treatment**


Both the timing of the beginning of treatment systems and the institutions from which they evolved influence
the characteristics of treatment today. Treatment has developed at different times in different countries. In·
many countries drug treatment systems came later than those for alcohol (Klingemann, Takala & Hunt, 1992;
Institute of Medicine, 1990b ). Partly because of that, in those particular countries, drug treatment has
sometimes been combined with alcohol treatment services.


As early as 1919 alcohol treatment policy was specified and developed at a level of importance equal to· that
of tuberculosis treatment policy in the former USSR. Norway organized alcohol treatment (specialized and
independent from health services) soon after the beginning of this century. Drug treatment has been included
as part ofthe.overall system as drug problems have become of concern. China's programme began in 1949.
In Hungary, the first welfare centres providing treatment for alcoholism began only in the mid-1960s and
alcohol policy has existed only since the mid-1970s. Again, drug treatment has been incorporated in such
policy but with heavier criminal justice involvement (see country reports in Klingemann, Takala & Hunt,
1992). While many voluntary organizations have provided alcohol treatment in the USA since the 1940s,
an official treatment system began only in 1970. The drug treatment system in the USA had more formal
beginnings, in conjunction with criminal justice interventions, and a national-level, ti·ee-standing system
began shortly after one for alcohol.


The remarkable diversity in the origins of treatment systems has also affected the characteristics of treatment
across countries. Treatment developed in connection with psychiatry in Austria (Eisenbach-Stangl, 1992)
and out of welfare organizations in Sweden (Rosenqvist & Kurube, 1992) and Finland (Takala & Lehto,
1992). In some countries, such as Switzerland and Finland the development of both alcohol and drug
treatment was greatly influenced by temperance movements (Klingemann, Takala & Hunt, 1992) while in
other countries that influence was absent. These differences in origin often influence drug and alcohol
treatment today. Some systems are part of welfare or health care. Poland's treatment system is located within
the mental health system. In Hungary, Mexico, Brazil, Canada and Britain, alcohol and drug treatment is
organized within the health care system. In the USA the public drug and alcohol treatment systems are free
standing. Norway's system is also specialized. Some systems appear to be well-integrated and others are
fragmented with part in public health, part in criminal justice and part in psychiatric services. A
complicating factor is whether drug and alcohol treatment is combined. The fact that the two systems often
have separate historical origins affects the nature of the combined system. Within the USA, for example, the
different development of alcohol and drug treatment (alcohol treatment influenced by mental health and
Alcoholics Anonymous and drug treatment influenced by criminal justice concerns) has influenced the types
of programmes, ideology of treatment, referral of clients and characteristics of clients today.


WHO/PSA/93. 10
page 40


Placement and organization of services


This section discusses the influences of the placement of treatment services (whether they are part of mental
health, public health, welfare, or are a free-standing system), the integration or separation of drug and alcohol
treatment services and the level of organization of services (whether they part of a centrally organized, federal
or local-level organization of service). These structural factors potentially influence the fragmentation,
heterogeneity and comprehensiveness of treatment.


Treatment systems today, influenced by their historical roots as well as by present forces, look very different
from country to country. In regard to organizational location, some are placed within the mental health
psychiatric services system, some are within general health care services, some are within welfare services
and some are a free-standing system of services. There is also tremendous disparity across countries in regard
to the level of government at which they are organized. As the country reports show in Klingemann, Takala
& Hunt, 1992, China's system has a three-tier network of services at state, collective and individual levels
(Klingemann, Takala & Hunt, 1992). Switzerland, Canada and the USA are among the countries with federal
systems. While Switzerland's systems seems to be consistent in its different regions, the USA and Canada
report striking differences in structure and programming from region to region or state to state. Poland,
Brazil and the former USSR are examples of countries with centralized systems. These variables help
determine the feasibility of central registry systems used to identify cases and coordinate or manage care for
individuals. Drug or alcohol registries are found, for example, in some of the Scandinavian centrally
organized services and are impossible to imagine in a decentralized system, such as in the USA.


Treatment ideology


Previous WHO efforts have played a large part in providing international and often broad-based agreement
on definitions of major concepts such as definitions of alcoholism and alcohol and drug dependence
syndromes (e.g. Edwards et al., 1977). For alcohol, the prevailing images found across countries include
alcoholism, alcohol dependence syndrome and alcohol problems. In the area of drugs, drug addiction and
drug abuse are predominantly listed as the problems being treated. Increasingly, "substance abuse" is used
as a problem label, encompassing abuse of both alcohol and other drug abuse. While "substance abuse" has
status as a diagnostic term in DSM-III-R, it is not used in ICD-10. Instead, ICD-10 uses the term "harmful
use" for patterns of use causing physical or mental problems and excludes patterns causing social problems
as being outside the scope of medical diagnosis. What is meant by "substance abuse" in treatment is likely
to vary dramatically both throughout the world and within countries as well. The acceptance of the disease
concept by professional circles in the vast majority of countries has not led to uniformity in philosophy. An
early WHO report ( 1973) of drug programmes in four countries illustrates how the different concepts upon
which treatment is based affect treatment.


Some countries have one dominant "governing image" (Room, 1978) of alcohol problems that shapes the
overall constellation of services. In the USA, adherence to the disease concept of alcoholism and the
influence of Alcoholics Anonymous are so strong that programme strategies throughout the country are
limited to those focusing on abstinence, although a range of treatment modalities exist. In the republics of
the former USSR, adherence to the disease concept through medical models is pervasive and programmes
based on behavioural and aversive conditioning represent the vast bulk of services (Ivanets et al., 1992).
When there is but one pervasive image, it has a very powerful effect on treatment. In contrast, in countries


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 41


such as Canada, Britain and Finland, competing definitions arc entertained and treatment methods include
controlled drinking strategies as well as abstinence strategies.


ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND TREATMENT ENTRY


The opportunities for access and patterns of entering treatment largely determine the sociodemographic
characteristics of treatment and these characteristics influence the content of treatment. This section
discusses these issues within the framework of availability of treatment and how cases enter treatment. Both
voluntary and involuntary treatment entries are discussed.


Availability of treatment


There is large variation in availability of treatment across countries. The concept of availability is more
complex than the per capita rate of services in a country. The relevant dimensions include the overall set of
services in terms of size and comprehensiveness, as well as the distribution of those services geographically,
by ability to pay and for all segments of the population in need. Thus, where people live and, for some
countries, if they have access to health insurance will greatly affect whether they enter treatment and what
kind of services they will receive.


Countries differ in terms of the extensiveness of their systems. Although the USA has a very large system
of services and its overall per capita ratio of services is high in several respects at the same time treatment
is not as available as in many other countries. Because of the financing patterns described above, the same
comprehensive set of services is not available for public and private clients, for rural and urban areas, and
for all regions of the country. The geographical placement of services also does not correlate highly with
various indices of problem levels, such as cirrhosis mortality or per capita consumption rates. Many have
argued that services appropriate for those with special needs, such as ethnic populations and women, arc
limited (Institute of Medicine, l990a). Treatment in Canada appears to be more evenly available to the
population in terms of the variables above. The former USSR has a large treatment system, but the types of
services are limited and not much is known about geographical availability or availability for special
populations. China's system is not as extensive as those listed above, but it is comprehensively distributed
over the population (Yanyi in Klingcmann, Takala & Hunt, 1992). Data arc not available to evaluate the
impact of these differences on treatment. We can surmise that availability is associated with the ability to
match client characteristics with treatment programmes. It also has an effect on health policy, on how
individuals get referred across health and social service agencies, and it may be related to clients' readiness
for treatment.


How cases come to treatment


While there is little cross-national information on referral sources for treatment and the individual and social
factors affecting treatment entry, it is clear that countries differ greatly in regard to how clients enter
treatment. For example, they differ in the weight placed on voluntary and involuntary referrals. Most
countries have mechanisms for voluntary self-referral but the actual statistics on and description of the
process are not well documented. Porter, Arif & Curran, (1986) surveyed the legislation and found selfreferred voluntary treatment to be one type of treatment, as is found in many African countries (e.g. Kenya,


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 42


Madagascar, Mauritius, Nigeria, Senegal and Zambia). The legislation on compulsory treatment for drugs
dependence is part of mental health legislation in some countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Japan, Somalia, Trinidad,
Togago and the USA), and in others is specifically alcohol-related, drug-related, or drug and alcohol
combined.


Almost all countries have some arrangements for compulsory treatment and most have their voluntary and
legal commitment services separated. The former USSR, for example, operated separate systems (Grant &
Ritson in Institute of Medicine, 1990a). Services tend to be included within the overall treatment systems
in other countries, such as the USA (Weisner, 1990). In many countries other types and levels of coercion
operate along with formal commitment legislation. Some countries, including the USA, Brazil, and Mexico,
include large numbers of clients from such sources in their alcohol and drug treatment systems. One of the
major changes in the USA over the past 10 years is that such referrals have come to be the
majority.


The extent and type of entryway to compulsory treatment vary across countries. The types include civil
commitment laws, specific laws regarding drinking or drugs (e.g. selling drugs, public drunkenness), laws
regarding substance related offenses (e.g. drunk driving), laws regarding drinking in the offence (e.g. child
abuse, burglary), and workplace coercion (e.g. employee assistance programmes and worksite identification,
such as described by Yani, 1992).
A wide range of definitions of drug dependence is found in the legislation related to treatment in different
countries. Definitions vary in terms of the required debilitation of the target population. The following are
some examples:


Mexico- "other than for therapeutic purposes, voluntarily uses, or experiences the need to use, any narcotic
or psychotropic substance."


Colombia - "the personal state brought about by periodic or continuous ingestion of drugs in any way."


Thailand- "consumes, ingests, or applies by any means the psychotropic substance and shows the symptom
of addiction to the psychotropic substance."


United Kingdom- "if, and only if, he has as a result of repeated administration become so dependent upon
the drug that he has an overpowering desire for the administration of it to be continued." (Porter, Arif &
Curran, 1986).


Definitions of treatment also vary, including terms such as "resocialization", "reintegration" and
"rehabilitation" (Porter, Arif & Curran, 1986). In addition, length of stay varies from eight hours to two years
(e.g. Sweden with eight hours, Australia with 14 days, Japan with 30 days, Switzerland and Hungary with
two years, Italy with an indeterminate length). The differences in length by country arc not necessarily related
to seriousness of reason for commitment.


Twenty-two of the 51 countries surveyed by Porter, Arif & Curran, ( 1986) had provisions for diversion from
the criminal justice system to treatment. In general, this "involves taking them out of the criminal justice
system and placing them in a treatment setting, sometimes suspending punishment, or providing treatment
while they are in confinement".


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 43


The pathways by which clients enter the system are likely to affect the characteristics of treatment populations
and the course of treatment. When referrals come from the health care system where medical problems are
the focus, they may require more attention to health problems than if other referral mechanisms had been
responsible. When referrals come from psychiatric services, clients may be more debilitated and have dual
drug or alcohol and psychiatric diagnoses. When referrals come from the criminal justice system, the
influences and targeted problems will be social problems and often require different treatment approaches.
Furthermore, referring institutions may differ in their expectations of the environment and controls of
treatment Criminal justice agencies referring clients may expect more monitoring in treatment and be more
concerned about the avoidance of illegal activities as outcome objectives than is the case with health care
agencies.


Clients from different referral sources, both voluntary and mandated, often represent different population
groups with different sociodemographic characteristics. These different groups often have different
problems, perceptions about problems, attitudes to alcohol and drugs, and financial and social resources.

Such differences often require careful consideration in treatment planning. The level of client readiness for
treatment and motivation will also vary by type of referral. This greatly affects treatment strategies such as
the length of time required to engage the client in treatment and the methods for doing so. There is also some
evidence that clients who are motivated perform better in treatment (Institute of Medicine, 1990a). The
treatment outcome literature in regard to compulsory treatment is not extensive. Compulsion appears to
heighten treatment compliance. However, there is no consensus in this literature about whether outcome rates
for compulsory treatment are significantly higher or lower than for voluntary treatment (see for example,
Institute of Medicine, 1990; Chopra, Preston & Gerson, 1979; Dunham & Mauss, 1982; Hser, Anglin &
Powers, 1990).


Because of the overall illicit status of drugs in relation to alcohol in most countries, there is reason to
anticipate that as drug and alcohol treatment are merged the overall effect on treatment will be to put it in a
more coercive frame (Weisner & Morgan, 1992). Furthermore, it is likely that the degree to which coercive
referrals are represented in the system will have a large impact on the overall structure, programming, and
course of treatment. The ESDA report (1992) found significant legislative changes in regard to drug
treatment in 20 countries. Most "provide for more flexibility in the prosecution of personal drug abuse,
including involuntary commitments". In several countries, questions have begun to be raised in r.-:!gard to the
civil rights of these clients in terms of case-fmding procedures, processing and treatment provisions. In some
cases these treatment clients had fewer due process rights than they would if they were processed by the
criminal justice system (Weisner, 1990). The ESDA report (1992) indicated that some of these measures
posed questions in regard to civil rights since they related to such procedures such as searches without
warrants and random urine tests in several countries.


**A LARGER VIEW OF HANDLING PROBLEMS IN THE COMMUNITY**


Other health and social service institutions in a community and their relationships affect the treatment of drug
and alcohol problems as well. This includes the prevalence of organizations providing alternative resources
to the treatment system, the interaction and referral processes between different community systems, the
availability of different types of health care and the influence of substance abuse programmes relative to other
institutional systems.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 44


Alternative resources


Treatment for drug and alcohol problems which is carried out in other health and social services is generally
not documented. Not to examine such resources, however, is to ignore services in many countries. (For
examples of Zambia and Mexico, see Calderon, Capillo-Serrano & Suarez, 1981; Ritson, 1985; Rootman
& Mosher, 1984 ). Some countries which do not have specialized treatment for substance abuse may have
a system of health services or welfare services that provides treatment for these problems, however defmed.
The extent to which the public sees these agencies as appropriate ones for this care will likely affect
participation and attitudes toward specialized treatment. In addition to public institutions, in many countries
such as Poland, Bulgaria, Britain and France, voluntary organizations play an important role in treatment
(Ozarin, 1973). In some cases, these agencies are subsidized.


The interaction between other health and social service agencies and substance abuse treatment systems
varies greatly from country to country. Some have official policies which set forth lines of referral and
definitions of cases for referral between these institutions and alcohol treatment. To a great extent this is
influenced by the organization of health care services in the country (i.e. whether they are centralized or
fragmented, whether there is a large demarcation between public and private services, and the amount of
resources). This may have an important effect on treatment to the extent that treatment programmes can
predict their population and set up guidelines with other institutions regarding what problems and individuals
are appropriate for services.


Types of health care in a community


Traditional methods of healing are an important part of health care throughout the world. In India and
Nigeria, for instance, a substantial part of the total health care is carried out by traditional services (Odejide
et al., 1992). While the extent to which substance abuse problems are handled through these care-givers is
undocumented, indications are that it is large. When belief systems of the populace fit with ideologies of
traditional healing, drug and alcohol treatment programmes and methods will be affected in order to
effectively attract clients to treatment and keep them there.


Influence of the treatment system in relation to other community institutions


The power relationships among different institutional systems in a community are important to consider when
examining extra-treatment influences on drug and alcohol treatment. The status of treatment in relation to
mental health, criminal justice, welfare and other relevant institutions varies across communities. Even within
communities these power relationships often shift over time. This affects both the amount of resources and
how they are allocated. This has not been docwnented comparatively across countries; however in the USA
in recent years the focus on the "drug war" and drunk driving has made the influence of the criminal justice
system on government policy far stronger than that of the public health/treatment system. Many treatment
providers claim that the criminal justice system sets policy in regard to who enters their public programmes
as well as the requirements of treatment. Thus the treatment population and the resources for treatment have
shifted to focus on those convicted of drug related crimes, alcohol related crimes and most recently "pregnant
addicts". The modem history of alcohol treatment in Poland also reflects these power relationships
(Morawski, 1992).


WHO/PSN93.10

**CONCLUSION**


Three current trends in many countries can be noted as illustrative of the social and economic forces
influencing treatment systems and strategies. The integration of drug and alcohol programmes, the use of
coercive tactics to establish entry to treatment and the new urgency which the AIDS epidemic has brought
to treatment issues are all clearly extra-treatment factors which have profound impacts on alcohol and drug
treatment systems and ideologies. These three examples serve to emphasize the complexity of the treatment
response to drug and alcohol problems.


The merging of drug and alcohol treatment programmes is significantly changing treatment in many places
today. While there is a growing belief that the etiology and epidemiology of drug and alcohol problems are
related, there are many differences in the traditional ideologies and methods of the two treatment institutions
and in public conceptions of the problems. Dramatic effects on the environment of programmes, the process
of treatment and the outcome of treatment arc to be expected when these programmes arc combined.


The AIDS epidemic has directly affected treatment in many countries. First, it has brought substance abuse
treatment to the attention of policy-makers, sometimes resulting in the provision of new resources for
treatment or the reallocation of existing services. In addition, it has forced a reconsideration of long-standing
treatment ideologies and strategies, especially in regard to abstinence versus harm reduction, and it has
brought about changes in treatment methods and the overall content of treatment.


The effects of the high prevalence of coercion and the intermingling of criminal justice systems and substance
abuse treatment in most countries arc not well understood. Little is known about the relationship of client
readiness and motivation to outcome, or about treatment outcome in coerced populations. Since coercion of
various extremes is a prominent characteristic of treatment in most countries, its effect on treatment bears
examining in a cross-cultural context.


Although there is increasing international agreement on fundamental definitions of drug and alcohol
dependence, treatment for these problems still varies dramatically from country to country. It seems clear
that many extra-treatment factors, both structural and individual, are responsible for these differences. This
paper has been an attempt to organize and document them. Unfortunately, information on many of these
issues is limited for many countries and for sub-populations within countries. There is more information
about how extra-treatment factors affect the organization and structure of treatment and the
sociodemographic characteristics of the treatment population than about how they affect the outcome of
treatment. However, the process and outcome of treatment is greatly determined by the sociodcmographic
characteristics of treatment populations. These are important issues for mapping treatment and planning
successful programmes in different cultural, legal and economic contexts.

**Ill.** **GENERALIST RESPONSES TO ALCOHOL AND OTHER**

**DRUG PROBLEMS**


**INTRODUCTION**


The greater part of the response to alcohol and other drug problems is delivered through persons other than
those working in specialized treatment facilities. When treatment responses to alcohol and other drug
problems are being mapped, these "generalist" efforts run a high risk of being underestimated or even
forgotten completely. "Generalist" here refers to all those responses, formal and informal, that arc made
by agencies other than those considered specialized centres for alcohol and other drug problems


Gencralist agencies, though not seen specifically as dealing with alcohol and other drug problems, often
help persons deal with the consequences of substance use and sometimes even directly intervene in assisting
them to change their substance-using behaviour. Individuals' substance use may also change, without ever
even being recorded, purely as an incidental accompaniment of changes in their lives resulting from
unrelated gencralist interventions.


Specialist services have usually been considered the pinnacle of possible responses. Services delivered by
all others, the so-called generalists, are viewed as probably inferior because they arc seen as necessarily
compromised in their effort to make the service available to a wider range of consumers. Services delivered
in most non-specialist facilities arc often modifications of, or derived from, specialist approaches.


There are major implications of this viewpoint for the way in which services arc conceived. Where any
significant specialist treatment service exists, this very existence strongly influences the nature of general ist
responses. Non-specialist services then subtly become considered as a lower rung in the hierarchy of
services. They arc seen as centres where not-so-highly-specialized services arc delivered, in the knowledge
that those for whom this less sophisticated intervention is inadequate can always be referred on for more
specialized management. Appropriate activities for the gcncralist setting, in this view, arc primarily
screening, early detection and elementary intervention followed by referral as required. This view may well
persist with regard to primary health care services in general, not only services for alcohol and Jthcr drug
problems.


Gcncralist services can also be considered as one clement in a range of interventions required to match the
range of problems clients have (Giascr, 1991 ). This view is not necessarily derived from "specialist
thinking" and is not hierarchical. It does, however, sec the gcncralist setting as appropriate only for
individuals in earlier stages of problems. This may be appropriate for developed countries, but for much
of the world's population the gcncralist setting is all that is available for all substance abuse problems and
levels of dependence.


Whether for persons with dependence problems, or hazardous consumption, probably the most important
feature about gcncralist settings is that they arc enormously more accessible than the specialized centres
This feature is clearly of the greatest consequence from the standpoint of the consumer, although perhaps
not given sufficient attention by service providers

Recent trends


The limitations of the traditional concept of specialist approaches have begun to be recognized, particularly
in the last 15 years or so. This trend has been furthered by the discussion of what exactly constitutes
treatment (Edwards et al., 1977; Edwards and Orford 1977). It is also recognized that interventions delivered through non-specialist settings can produce significant improvements (Kristenson et al., 1983;
Chick et al., 1984; Elvy et al., 1988; Wallace et al., 1988; WHO 1991), with at least one study providing
evidence of comparability of results from specialist and generalist interventions (Drummond et al., 1990).


The importance of the generalist setting is also recognized in light of increasing information about the
proportion of persons with problems with whom specialist services deal. In North America, for example,
the estimates are that fewer than one in five persons with severe alcohol problems has contact with
alcoholism treatment services (Baekeland & Lundwall, 1977; Smart et al., 1980; Hingson et al., 1982).
In other parts of the world too, the majority of persons with severe problems do not seem to present
themselves readily for treatment (Grant & Ritson, 1990).


The more important issue, however, is that persons with mild to moderate problems far outnumber those
with severe problems (Cahalan, 1970; Hi !ton, 1987; Institute of Medicine, 1990). Due to the much larger
numbers of those with less severe problems, this group is beginning to be recognized as the more
appropriate focus for intervention (Moore & Gerstein, 1981; Kreitman, 1986; Institute of Medicine, 1990).


As locations that provide opportunity for earlier intervention with promising results, the non-specialist
medical facilities are increasingly more on the map. Authoritative bodies and commissioned reviews in
several countries make recommendations that a greater role be assigned to primary health care professionals
in response to substance abuse problems (Royal College of General Practitioners, 1986; Institute of
Medicine, 1990; Heather et al., 1990).


The focus of treatment also appears to be changing. No longer is interest focused primarily on drug
dependence or alcoholism as such, but on drug-related problems as well. Mild problems are seen more and
more as appropriate for intervention (Institute of Medicine, 1990; Kreitman, 1986). The notion of
"hazardous alcohol consumption" draws the line even earlier (Edwards et al., 1981; Saunders & Aasland,
1987). There are cautious suggestions that it may be appropriate to target alcohol consumption itself
(Institute of Medicine, 1990, p227; Babor et al., 1987), including the suggestion that the notion of "safe
limits" may be dropped (Kreitman, 1986). ··These ideas do not appear to have been strongly taken up.


Much of the literature on generalist responses deals with working at the level of the individual via
predominantly medical services. The range of services beyond the merely medical needs to be given
attention, as many people with alcohol and other drug problems are dealt with by services such as law
enforcement, social assistance, and education. This may be even more true in those countries where medical
services are poorly developed.


Attention so far has not focused. on utilizing the generalist settings, or for that matter the specialist ones,
in a broad effort to reduce alcohol and other drug use at community level. Instead, attention is interventions
directed at the level of the individual or the family, not at the level of consumption by the community as a
whole.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page _55_


There are some differences in the considerations that apply to different classes of substance. Fear or
distaste in which illicit drug users are sometimes held may cause reluctance on the part of generalists in
dealing with them. Another major difference is that in the case of illicit drugs, any form of use is much
more likely to be considered as requiring intervention.


PRESENTATIONS IN GENERALIST SETTINGS


Subjects with alcohol and other drug problems come to attention mostly as a result of the harmful
consequences of their substance use. In many instances attention may be directed only at the consequence,
or substance related problem, instead of focusing on the underlying substance use. There are also other
instances where individuals with alcohol and other drug problems attend services for incidental issues.
These instances too may present opportunities for screening for substance problems if certain of these
settings draw a significant number of problem users.


The number of service sectors which would draw proportionately large numbers of problem substance users
are many. The following is a sampling of the most important of such non-specialist settings.


Health care settings


The most readily recognized settings are the different facilities of the health care delivery system itself.
Included here are primruy care or general practitioner facilities, emergency services and all ambulatory and
inpatient care facilities including "specialties" other than drug treatment services - orthopaedics, for
example.


It is recognized that there is a far higher proportion of persons with alcohol or other drug-related problems
among those who present at these services than in the general population (Holt et al., 1980; Mclntosh,
1982; Davis, 1984; Cyr & Wartman, 1988; Moore et al., 1989). The Institute of Medicine (1990, p. 230)
in its comprehensive review makes this unequivocal recommendation:


"The committee therefore believes that all persons coming for care to medical settings should
be screened for alcohol problems. If mild or moderate problems are present, a brief
intervention should be provided in situation and observed for its effect; if substantial or severe
problems are present, a referral to specialized treatment should be effected. Absence of this
kind of approach, alcohol consumption that incurs a risk to the health of the individual or to the
health of others, or that incurs a risk of alcohol problems, is likely to go unnoticed or
unaddressed. Some persons, in particular those with mild or moderate problems, will not
perceive these problems as requiring specialized attention and will not accept a referral to a
specialist treatment apparatus. Others who may be willing to grant that alcohol consumption
is a problem for them also will not accept referral, for a variety of reasons. For these people
the delivery of brief intervention in the medical setting may offer the only opportunity for
effective assistance; as noted above, there is considerable evidence that brief interventions can
be effective."


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 56


Health care personnel


The personnel in the generalist medical settings who currently deliver these services are mainly doctors and
nurses in developed countries but include a variety of other levels of primary health care staff in the less
developed coWltries. The need to include adequate education about alcohol problems as part of the general
Wldergraduate or basic training is coming to be recognized (Holden, 1985; Lewis et al., 1987). The case
for including problems related to drugs other than alcohol is not being pushed as vigorously.


In the case of nurses, the existing responses have included using them in various trials on service delivery
(Kristensen et al., 1983; Chick et all984), where their suitability for the task has been well demonstrated.
Training in the recognition of and appropriate interventions for alcohol and other drug problems is
reportedly not yet included as part of basic nurse training. A case is made in the Institute of Medicine
(1990) report for the inclusion of this element as part of basic nurse training just as it is included in
undergraduate training in at least some medical schools.


Law enforcement settings


The agencies involved here include the police, the courts, prisons and probation services. Among the
persons dealt with by these agencies, it is recognized that there is a far greater representation of people with
alcohol and other drug problems than in the general population. The case for including non-specialist
screening and intervention programmes through the law enforcement system would not be difficult to make.
Most subjects recruited through this system would have an element of enforced compliance, which has both
negative and positive effects on the treatment process and outcome.


Existing responses appear more directed towards referral to specialist treatment facilities whenever overt
alcohol and drug problems are detected. This mode of disposal by the criminal justice system may be
determined more by existing trends or fashions than by the real level of the recipient's need. In the USA,
for example, the specialist treatment sector is reportedly flooded in some areas with "driving while
intoxicated" offences (State of Connecticut, 1988).


Special treatment services for medical needs exist within most prison services in many coWltries. These
are not special units for alcohol and drug problems so the considerations that apply to generalist medical
settings discussed in the preceding section would apply to these medical settings. They are likely to draw
an even higher proportion of those who require interventions for alcohol and drug problems than general
medical settings elsewhere. It is a feature of prison life in several COWltries that alcohol, tobacco and other
drugs are illicitly available for those serving prison terms.


In some coWltries substance use is considered as requiring a response that is more penal than therapeutic.
Imprisonment constitutes the primary response to drug problems in several countries and there are often
more drug abusers in prison than in treatment. This raises questions not only as to which responses are
more practical, effective, or in the public health interest, but also as to the human rights of the drug user,
including his or her right to health care services.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 57


Law enforcement personnel


Personnel that may be appropriately involved include staff in clinics and other medical facilities as well as
regular custodial staff in penal and correctional institutions. Probation officers, or their equivalent, would
perhaps be the most important professional group within this system since they have a rather special
relationship with clients still living in the community. Police officers at present have hardly any
introduction to the significant impact on drug using behaviour they may have as an incidental part of their
ordinary duties. The impact of drug problems on the staff itself is of particular importance in the law
enforcement sector.


Another important role for law enforcement and judicial services may be in implementing changes at
community or the wider social level. The activities of communal justice agencies undoubtedly already have
an impact in different ways on community attitudes and practices, as well as on the availability of alcohol
and other drugs in different parts of the world. These activities include the restriction of the availability of
drugs, including alcohol, as well as control of intoxicated behaviour in public. The impact of the policy
underlying the manner in which these sorts of activities are pursued has a major bearing on individual
alcohol and drug consumption. How these existing responses are governed and how they may be even more
effectively harnessed has not been reported on in depth.


Persons working in law enforcement settings are much more likely than those in health care settings to see
licit and illicit drug problems as requiring entirely different responses since their responsibilities towards
these problems differ markedly in law. This distinction in the manner in which different classes of
substances are perceived by law enforcers will have a powerful influence on the help they can provide to
different groups of substance users.


Social assistance and social welfare settings


Included here are all social assistance programmes, social services, housing assistance programmes and all
fonns of public welfare agencies. As with the two settings described above, social service settings include
a high proportion of persons with drug problems (Murray, 1977~ Spiegelman & Smith, 1985). Family
service agencies frequently deal with individuals who manifest alcohol and other drug problems, as well as
with families in difficulty because of the substance use of one member. Agencies working with the
homeless are similarly recorded as dealing with persons having problems relating to alcohol and drug use
(Institute of Medicine, 1990).


Agencies in developed countries - especially those including a component of "social work" -probably
already address these problems to some extent. The nature of such intervention, however, is not clearly
documented. There are recommendations for the inclusion of training for identification and intervention
by these agencies (Ehline & Tighe, 1977; Deakins, 1983).


It is just as likely that the corresponding agencies in developing countries are faced with a situation similar
to that which is seen in the developed countries. Again, there is no documentation of responses delivered
through these agencies and it is likely that individual workers in these settings deal with substance use
problems as they think fit, if they deal with them at all.


WHO/PSA/93 .10
page 58


Social assistance personnel


The most relevant personnel through whom service delivery in these agencies can be channelled are social
workers. The basic training of social workers already includes attention to alcohol and other drug problems.
Comprehensive and systematic training on the generalist interventions they could deliver needs to be
included both in basic social work training as well as in-service training for already qualified social workers.


Occupational settings


Where assistance programmes are available for employees, these too are likely to draw a sizable number
of persons with alcohol and other drug problems. Formal employee assistance programmes are more a
feature of the developed societies. The trend in such programmes at present appears to refer these problems
elsewhere when they are encountered (Institute of Medicine, 1990). There are no reports of specific nonspecialist interventions being carried out at present through any of these agencies.


Personnel in employment settings


Employer attention to substance abuse problems, especially those related to alcohol, is becoming evident.
Appropriate training for delivery of interventions needs to be considered within the employment setting.
Delivery of interventions through the occupational setting may carry an element of coercion that is not as
immediately apparent as that of the criminal justice system. The merits and demerits of this must be
carefully weighed.


Educational settings


Schools, universities and other educational settings undoubtedly have their share of persons with substance
use problems. Drug and alcohol use is probably more likely to lead to problems when begun at a younger
age. Interventions may therefore have greater impact when directed at those beginning to experiment at an
early age. It is not clear, however, whether those in educational settings constitute a special"risk group"
as such. Those who have dropped out of school, for instance, are more likely than their peers in school to
be experimenting with or regularly using psychoactive substances.


Educational personnel


The appropriate personnel for delivery of services within schools would be school counsellors, where they
exist, or selected teachers who could be trained to deliver such interventions within the school system itself.
Students may tend to takt: more heed of interventions coming from their peers, but a large effort is needed
to maintain this kind of service on an ongoing basis.


Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) and Voluntary Agencies


The role played by these agencies differs considerably throughout the world. In less developed countries
these agencies sometimes become the principal source of delivery for certain kinds of services. Various
assistance programmes for individuals and families in distress, such as health interventions, emergency and
other relief and service provisions are all areas in which the NGO sector may significantly contribute to the


WHO/PSA/93.10

page _59_


formal sector - or may even supplant it - as the main agency involved in delivery. Much of what is
discussed under "Social Assistance" may readily apply to the NGO sector in some developing countries.


NGO personnel


NGOs that are specifically engaged in helping individuals through counselling and other support would
already have training for the personnel involved. This may not include specific instruction in appropriate
responses for those with substance abuse problems. In looking at the range of people through whom
generalistresponses could be delivered, those in the NGO sector constitute an important resource in many
countries of the world.


Counselling services, help-lines and crisis intervention services


As with most other helping agencies, these services draw a fair share of people with substance abuse
problems. The considerations that apply to primary health care settings generally apply here as well.


Helping agency personnel


Personnel in these facilities already have some experience in dealing with these problems, but may be a
useful group to train for more systematic delivery of non-specialist interventions.


EXISTING RESPONSES


In both developed and developing countries, generalist services offer an important avenue of intervention.
They come across a much larger proportion of substance abuse problems than the specialist services and
have been found to be effective in bringing about significant changes, although through relatively modest
interventions. They also have the advantage of allowing access to a large group of people who would not
be appropriate for specialist management and who for various reasons are not willing to use the specialist
service even if it were appropriate for them. It is also likely that individuals in earlier stages of substance
abuse problems would respond better to intervention, and in this regard generalist settings can offer an
opportunity for more effective intervention than the specialist settings.


Attempts at utilizing the potential that these services offer include efforts to improve the recognition or
identification of persons with existing or potential problems related to their substance use. Such measures
include the use of screening questionnaires, clinical scales and laboratory investigations. Appropriate
interventions for delivery by non-specialist staff are being experimentally evaluated for their effectiveness.
Most of these approaches are directed primarily at alcohol rather than at other substances of abuse.


There are striking differences in the responses by these various agencies in different countries. The scope
of the interventions made through the agencies discussed in the previous section can vary from being nonexistent to highly specialized. A very broad distinction can be drawn between the most developed countries
and the least developed.


The nature of interventions in the more developed parts of the world appears to have been derived from
services undertaken by the specialist centres. As in most other specialties, undergraduate medical training


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 60


in abuse of alcohol and other drugs is conducted by the specialists who deal with substance abuse problems.
Lower rungs in the medical hierarchy were initially expected to detect and refer those with problems to the
special agencies that deal with them. Even as generalists were encouraged to undertake elementary
interventions, they could count on the backing of the more specialist agency for referral in cases of
difficulty.


Services to be delivered by the less specialized agencies are formulated and tested by the specialists (e.g.,
Edwards et al., 1977~ Babor et al., 1986). The structure of a hierarchy of services through which clients
or patients move to the appropriate level remains the model, in keeping with that of all other medical
specialties. The importance of the role to be played by generalist settings is being acknowledged by
specialists who are now moving to develop interventions appropriate for generalist settings. There is,
however, hardly any documentation on what is actually delivered by the generalists in their responses. A
matter of equal interest would be the study of their referral patterns.


Many generalists still probably feel reluctant to deal with individuals with substance abuse problems.
Reluctance stems not only from the generalists' uncertainty about their own ability to handle the problems
involved. The common perception that persons with dependence are undesirable or troublesome may
contribute to this reaction. There are also the limitations of the setting, which may not be equipped to
handle the problems that dependent persons present. Among the limitations are the lack of facilities and
expertise needed to handle the various crises and demands that a some of the users may present.


ln poorer countries, generalist services rarely have access to a specialist substance abuse treatment facility.
Instead of being encouraged to identity alcohol and other drug related problems, these non-specialist
agencies are faced with a different kind of difficulty - that of providing a service for those with obvious and
severe alcohol and drug problems when no other help is available. Referral facilities, psychological or
psychiatric ones, are not often an option as they would be for medical problems.


The responses in these countries are quite different from those in more developed countries. As they are not
always informed or backed by specialist approaches and have often come about on an ad hoc basis,
approaches which have evolved as a result of agencies being forced to deal with alcohol and other drug
problems may be quite idiosyncratic. They are certainly not well researched or documented and therefore
are hardly ever regarded as valid.


However, innovations and approaches used in the less developed parts of the world need to be taken
seriously. They may well be no less effective than methods used in better-known settings. It is likely that
methods used represent the most suitable compromise between the demands made upon these services and
the resources available. Deliberate attention to and evaluation of the methods used in such under-resourced
areas may serve as a useful source of new ideas.


Examples from developing countries


The foregoing discussion on generalist responses to alcohol and other drug problems is heavily biased
towards approaches that have been reported in scientific journals. There is also a heavy leaning towards
those approaches that are delivered through agencies in the health care sector, as compared to other sectors
that also deal with substance abuse problems, although not specifically designated. We need to look in


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 61


addition at unpublished material and to seek infonnation from persons who may be aware of developments
that are worth pursuing even though not reported.


Work in developing countries is rarely reported. There is not very much pressure on professionals in these
countries to publish, even as a means to personal advancement. A professional in a developing country has
great difficulty in meeting the specifications of established journals because of poor access to infonnation
and to others professionals working in their field. Yet it is in these countries that the vast majority of
substance abuse problems are encountered. Below is a brief sketch of the situation in less developed
countries, with examples of some generalist interventions that have taken place.


In developing countries, services are not readily available to large segments of the population. Most
services are concentrated in the largest cities, where a wide range is often available. In rural areas, however,
there is a dearth of even basic generalist medical practitioners. Essential medical services are delivered
through paramedical staff, such as public health midwives, and in some settings by volunteer village health
workers who have received only the briefest of training.


Responses to substance abuse problems, like responses to all other medical needs - including diarrhoea!
diseases, malaria and snakebite, to name a few - have to be delivered via these basic generic medical
auxiliaries. Quite often it is whether a health worker can be spared from other pressing demands, as
opposed to the needs substance abusers have, which establishes the criterion of service delivery.


Interventions in this kind of milieu are much more generalist than is conceived by the affluent world, in that
they quite often include responses that are initiated and carried out by the community itself, as opposed to
those that are delivered through a particular service sector. In other words, the lack of an initiative by the
community means that the problem never receives attention. Thus substance abuse problems increase to
very high levels of severity with no conscious response whatsoever. Mechanisms by which responses come
to be initiated are unclear, and their initiation is not necessarily related directly to the impact of the problem.


Drug abuse problems in developing countries often tend to involve the wider community. For example,
treatment responses to cocaine abuse in Bolivia and Peru are often linked to an extended community effort
rather than directed at individual families. Similarly, programmes to assist inhalant using youth in Mexico
or drug-using street children in Bolivia also use resources within the community to assist the user in coming
off drugs.


An example of a community response to drug problems is provided by community detoxification camps
begun in places in India. In the "camp" approach, a community with a high prevalence of heroin abuse
works, as a community, to deal with the treatment needs of the affected group. A suitable location is found
where the heroin users are housed for approximately two weeks, during which members of the community
provide security and cater for the needs of the persons being detoxified. Medication is provided as
recommended by a consultant, who is usually someone from the nearest drug treatment facility. Help with
reintegration into the community commences at the camp and continued supervision becomes a matter of
concern for the wider community, not just for the individual's family.


Detoxification camps in areas with high prevalence of heroin abuse are often initiated as outreach efforts
of drug treatment facilities, but these camps in turn initiate more community-based efforts in adjacent


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 62


localities. An important feature of their initiation is the community's collective consciousness that some
response needs to be made to the problems relating to substance abuse.


The resulting response is truly communal. It not only addresses the needs of the drug-using population, but
also extends to the community's need to reduce the risk to unaffected youth, i.e. preventing the ready
availability of heroin. The response then includes attempts either to drive away or to confront heroin dealers
and street pushers. This form of extension from a primarily therapeutic response to a preventive effort is
possible because the response is totally unspecialized and need is felt within the community, rather than
as a service extended from outside.


Sri Lanka has had a different experience, deriving from what were initially drug preventive activities
involving youth groups and entire communities, sometimes centred around Buddhist temples. A feature
of these efforts is that they often lead to a change in community attitudes towards drug use and public
behaviour while intoxicated. With changes in community perception of drug use, current users sometimes
approach those involved in these preventive activities to seek help in modifYing their drug and alcohol
habits. Therapeutic responses occurring from a result of these requests are truly generalist.


Responses to substance abuse problems in such instances have taken the form of detoxification and
rehabilitation efforts via the Buddhist temple, which is an undoubtedly generalist setting. Other responses
include group efforts as a means to giving up smoking. These are examples of movement from purely
preventive activities to those that are more therapeutic, i.e., the example cited from India, where a primarily
therapeutic effort expanded to include a preventive component, as opposed to the example from Sri Lanka,
which is a demonstration of flexibility in the other direction.


Non-specialist treatments are both more flexible and more open to integration with preventive efforts than
are specialist approaches. This integration is more likely in those countries where a significant proportion
of treatment occurs in generalist settings. At least some of the efforts used in less developed countries
appear to provide a synthesis between treatment and preventive efforts. This is hardly surprising since
those engaged in drug prevention activities in deprived areas are approached, they need to respond to
treatment needs because there is simply no other option.


Although both preventive and curative interventions are delivered by the same agency as a matter of
necessity, it may perhaps be useful to consider this as a deliberate option to be followed elsewhere. The
optionofpursuingpolicies that affect whole communities rather than only individuals (Moskowitz 1989),
has already been proposed as a choice for developed countries' use (Moore & Gerstein, 1981).


In poorer countries the responses delivered at generalist settings are mainly directed towards individuals
who are more severely or obviously affected than those in similar settings in the more developed countries.
The settings in developing countries, although responding in some way to the obviously affected individual,
do not detect the less obviously affected ones or attempt to intervene with them. Methods for early
identification of problem and hazardous drinking are just as relevant for these countries as for developed
ones. In this regard, screening instruments specifically found to be useful in detecting earlier stages of
problem use would be particularly useful.


WHO/PSA/93.10

Screening instruments


Screening procedures have evolved from those designed to detect alcoholism to those designed to detect
alcohol problems. The most widely used of the earlier genre is perhaps the Michigan Alcoholism Screening
Test or MAST (Selzer 1971), of which various modified versions were developed (Pokomy et al., 1972;
Selzer et al., 1975). Similarly, the simple instrument referred to as the CAGE questionnaire (Cutdown on
drinking, Annoyance with criticisms about drinking, Guilt about drinking and using alcohol as an Eyeopener) was found suitable for detecting alcoholism (May:field et al., 1974; Ewing, 1984), but was not liable
to detect less severe problems (Saunders & Kershaw, 1980). The Munich Alcoholism Test (Feuerlein et
al., 1986) and the McAndrew Alcoholism Scale (McAndrew, 1965; Gottesman et al., 1989) are similarly
not applicable to the group with less severe problems.


Clinical examination which looks for abnormal physical fmdings has been used for screening (Le Go Grid),
sometimes complemented with items from the clinical history (Skinner et al., 1986), while the search for
biochemical markers continues (Beresford et al., 1982; Allen et al., 1988). A convenient and rapid
biochemical method involves the use of a "dipstick", a method which has been found to give reasonably
accurate results (Peachey and Kapur, 1986).


Despite these developments, laboratory examinations are considered less useful than questionnaires in
identifYing new cases (Institute of Medicine, 1990). One problem with laboratory examinations is that they
have a relatively lower level of sensitivity and generally cost more than questionnaire methods. A further
difficulty with laboratory methods, especially for developing countries, is that they are unsuitable for
widespread use in places where medical facilities are limited. Laboratory screening is, however, an area in
which new developments are likely to overcome existing difficulties and limitations (WHO 1990).


Compared to all these instnunents, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test or AUDIT questionnaire
offers the most promise since it identifies, in primary care settings, harmful and hazardous use rather than
severe dependence (Babor et al., 1989). It has been cross-nationally standardized by validation in primary
health care patients in six countries of different socioeconomic level and has been found to be of high
sensitivity and specificity. When the screening agent feels that the subject is not providing accurate
answers, or where additional infonnation is desired, there is a supplementary Clinical Screening Procedure
which can be added. AUDIT, while, not a diagnostic instrument, has the potential of being useful in
appropriately directing persons to different types of intervention.


Screening tests for other drugs have not kept pace with developments in the alcohol field. Biochemical
markers are heavily relied upon as the means of detection. It is quite likely that, in the case of these drugs
too, questionnaires could provide a sensitive screening method and there is no doubt that they would be
easier to apply across a wide variety of settings.


Although screening instnunents have been demonstrated to be useful on experimental testing, there are no
reports of their regular and widespread use in ordinary service delivery.


More recent developments


Until recently the generalist setting was seen as the most appropriate for detecting and then referring on the
alcoholic or drug dependent. With the recognition that there are many clients who require intervention but


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 64


for whom referral is not appropriate, interest has begun to focus on interventions that may be delivered
through non-specialists. Referral here must be recognized as an important intervention. There may be
significant changes arising simply from just being referred, even when the client does not take up the offered
referral (Elvy, 1988).


It must be understood in discussing the generalist response that this does not necessarily have to be equated
with assistance offered only to those with mild problems or hazardous use. In settings that have the luxury
of a range of services, the generalist response would automatically be equated with the service appropriate
for the less severely affected We must bear in mind, however, that the so-called generalist response is the
only response available for the entire range of substance abuse problems and levels of dependence in many
countries.


Generalist interventions in developed countries have evolved specifically with the less severely affected user
in mind. The number of such interventions is likely to be as many as the number of individual practitioners
in generalist settings. These practitioners have always had persons with differing degrees of drug-related
problems consulting them either directly or indirectly. Yet attempts have not been made until recently to
direct these responses in any systematic fashion or to evaluate their effects. The interventions now being
tried out for effectiveness in a more systematic manner seem to be attracting the generic label "brief
intervention" (Institute ofMedicine, 1990; WHO, 1991).


"Brief intervention" is considered to be quite distinct from "brief therapy" (Glaser, 1991). Brief therapy
is delivered by staff with some form of specialist training. Thus, brief therapy is at a higher level of
technical training, and is applicable only to a minority of those requiring intervention. Brief therapy is brief
only in relation to the usual timescale in which the relevant specialist therapeutic procedures are delivered.
Brief therapy is delivered over approximately six formal sessions and includes behavioural methods for
controlling drinking, assertiveness or social skills training and various forms of cognitive therapy. Although
abbreviated to apply them more widely, brief therapies are in no way envisaged as interventions to be
delivered by the non-specialist.


Screening implies a readiness to intervene. Brief interventions are a response to this need, to be delivered
in a setting where resources are unlikely to be available for diagnosis and treatment in the usual sense. The
history of early and simple interventions aimed at hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption is not long
(Edwards et al., 1977; Russell et al., 1979; Miller & Rester, 1980; Kristensen et al., 1983; Chick, 1984;
Elvy, 1988; Wallace, 1988; WHO, 1991). While these strategies for intervention are being tested, self-help
manuals have been developed for these problems (Miller & Taylor, 1980; Miller & Mufioz, 1982; Heather,
1986; Heather et al., 1986).


Some of the initial brief interventions were relatively time-consuming and aimed at achieving specific
changes using abbreviated forms of specialist behavioural management (Miller & Rester 1980). Later
studies have attempted to deliver these interventions, broadly falling under the heading of behavioural selfcontrol training, more efficiently (Alden, 1988). However, the specific behavioural methods, even if
suitable for delivery at general practice clinics, do not quite fall under the category of generalist
interventions for the purposes of this paper.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 65


A much more generalist or non-specific intervention was found useful in changing the drinking habits of
middle-aged men in the Swedish study in Malmo (Kristensen et al., 1982). The identification was based
on a laboratory estimation of serum enzyme level and the intervention consisted of regular feedback of the
results of repeated enzyme studies and counselling by a nurse, focused on living habits. This relatively
simple intervention was helpful in reducing both the medical and the social consequences of heavy drinking.
The main disadvantage of this method with regard to general applicability is that it requires facilities for
laboratory testing of a level that may not be readily available.


In a related study at the Edinburgh Royal Inflflllacy, the addition of a counselling session with a nurse,
lasting up to 60 minutes, made a significant improvement to problems related to alcohol (Chick et al.,
1984). There was no significant difference, however, in reduction of alcohol consumption when compared
to a control group. The intervention here also included the use of a self-help booklet. This study is more
in keeping with the idea of brief intervention as a generalist response.


The original study of Edwards and others ( 1977) was not conducted strictly in a generalist setting but has
served to generate more interest in the potential offered by brief interventions than any other. This
intervention was ideally suited for use as a non-specialist intervention since it was not in any way
technically complicated and was not heavily time-consuming. In a paper that amounts to a discussion of
the implications of this study, Edwards & Orford (1977) concluded that the approach to alcoholism
treatment should in general include less intervention than has been the fashion. They also suggested that
the process of reviewing one's own situation may be the factor that is of therapeutic value to the person or
family concerned.


In a study of interventions by general medical practitioners, Wall ace and others ( 198 8) reported a more than
two-fold reduction in consumption in the intervention group compared to the control group, as the result
of a session that covered the clients' current patterns of consumption and related problems and included the
issue of an information pamphlet. The authors concluded that general practitioners and other members of
the primacy health care team should be encouraged to include counselling about alcohol consumption in
their preventive activities.


A similar study of an even briefer intervention (of one or two minutes' duration) by general practitioners
has provided evidence that giving smokers an information leaflet and a warning that they will be followed
up resulted in a significant increase in the number giving up smoking (Russell, 1979).


A WHO study (WHO, 1991) in search of a generally applicable intervention has found that male drinkers
who received an intervention consisting of five minutes of simple advice reduced their consumption
significantly compared to those who did not receive this advice. More intensive intervention did not lead
to greater improvement.


Although many of the formal studies on brief intervention have been carried out on alcohol users, the
applicability of similar approaches for other drugs is recognized (Institute of Medicine, 1990). The
implications of most of the studies on brief intervention are best summarized in the Institute of Medicine
(1990) report, as follows:


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 66


"It appears that a variety of techniques can be deployed in different settings by various kinds
of personnel without disrupting the usual flow of activities and that such techniques can
produce significant and health-relevant effects."


The idea of secondary prevention through low-cost non-specialist efforts directed at those in early phases
of developing problems is clearly attracting interest. Initial results of the efforts so far give cause for
optimism as to the possible beneficial impact of these interventions. Along with these generalist
interventions a further line of experiment has used self-help manuals as a means of bringing about change.
Results indicate that there is a subgroup of those with hazardous or harmful consumption who improve with
this kind of minimal intervention (Heather, 1986; Heather et al., 1986; Miller & Rester, 1980; Miller &
Muiioz, 1982).


The ingredients that constitute these successful interventions are few. The elements include advising the
person that his or her consumption is high and then persuading that person that it needs to be reduced. This
involves giving evidence that the individual's consumption is higher than that of the general population or
that it is hazardous, feedback oflaboratory investigation results, monitoring consumption, continued followup appointments and the use of self-help literature. These elements are used in different combinations and
it is not yet clear which is the most important.


It remains possible, of course, that the ingredients of the brief intervention package are not really of great
consequence to the results of the intervention. The mechanism of improvement with minimal interventions
may relate to an individual propensity in a subgroup of alcohol or drug users and not to the specific
therapeutic ingredient delivered through the intervention. Results with a variety of these interventions
suggest that there is a group of substance users who are, in a sense, "prepared" to limit or discontinue their
use. This group could be postulated as having a fluctuating pattern of use - one which shows rapid change
with very little intervention.


Those persons responding to "advice", feedback of biochemical test results, mutual surveillance,
bibliotherapy and a host of other interventions, may well be the same ready-made group. If this is indeed
the case we need to be looking for ways to deliver a stimulus of some sort to all drinkers in order to reach
this group as widely as possible, rather than trying to designate which intervention is crucial for success.


**CONCLUSION**


Common to all generalist approaches is that they are entirely non-specialized and highly flexible. They
often include an element of community involvement or awakening to the problem in their midst. Social
involvement, when it occurs, is a powerful agent of change, but is however possible only in a truly generalist
effort.


Broad-based and powerful community responses have been initiated in some developing country locations
through generalist efforts. Where such responses are successfully initiated, the efforts are highly costeffective because they bring about changes related to both therapeutic and primary preventive goals. It
appears to make sense, in these endeavours, to address primary, secondary and tertiary prevention issues
as part of one effort. This synthesis of different goals in the one effort has been the result of local


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 67


conditions rather than deliberate choice. Observations suggest that such a synthesis may be of use to the
more affluent world as well.


There are, therefore, lessons to be learned from both developed and developing country settings. The
success or failure of screening procedures and brief or minimal interventions may fmd application in less
developed countries where professional time is at even greater premium than in the developed world.
Similarly, syntheses between treatment and preventive efforts, now almost forcibly made a feature of some
activities in developing countries, may be worth picking up as a rational approach to be used in developed
country settings as well.

**IV. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF DEPENDENCE**

**ON ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS: AN OVERVIEW**


**INTRODUCTION**


Drug dependence, i.e., dependence on psychoactive substances, is a complex process with a number of
related but distinct aspects. These include drug-using behaviour itself, drug intoxication, withdrawal
syndromes, relapse, drug-induced organ toxicity and psychopathological states that might contribute to
initiation of, or relapse into, drug use. These aspects involve quite different underlying physiological and
psychological mechanisms, all of which constitute possible targets for therapeutic intervention. Many
different potentially therapeutic agents have therefore been tested and used in treating or managing the
various aspects of drug dependence.


The factors motivating drug-using behaviour, including antecedent psychopathology, are to some extent
independent of the type of drug used. It is generally believed that all abusable psychoactive drugs, despite
differences in their specific receptors and molecular mechanisms of action, share the property of activating
a "reward" circuit in the brain, and thus of initiating effects that reinforce (i.e., increase the probability of
repeating) the drug-taking behaviour. In some individuals, genetic factors or pre-existing depression,
anxiety, or other emotional disturbances may make these reinforcing effects of drugs even stronger. Any
therapeutic agent that could block or modulate the reinforcing effects of drugs, or relieve the symptoms of
psychopathology that add to the strength of the reinforcing effects, would be potentially useful in treating
dependence on any type of psychoactive substance. Thus, at least conceptually, the same therapeutic agent
may be useful in the treatment of dependence on psychoactive substances of various kinds.


The other aspects mentioned above, however, including the features of drug intoxication, withdrawal
syndromes and organ toxicity, are relatively drug-specific. Many of the common medical complications
of alcohol dependence, such as cytotoxicity in the liver, pancreas or the brain, are directly attributable to
the metabolism of ethanol or the pharmacological actions of ethanol or its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde,
and may be amenable to pharmacotherapeutic intervention. To some extent this is also true of cocaine and
amphetamines. In contrast, most of the organic complications of use of other drugs are consequences of
the route and manner of drug administration, rather than of the drug action _per se_ (e.g., miliary abscesses,
or AIDS, in intravenous opioid or cocaine users or lung cancer in tobacco smokers) and do not lend
themselves to specific pharmacotherapy within the context of this review. Therefore this aspect is not
covered in relation to all types of drug dependence.


Finally, some agents have been tested for potential value in treating more than one aspect of dependence
on the same category of psychoactive substance. Consequently, some agents may be mentioned in more
than one place and context.

MEDICATIONS FOR ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE


Alcohol intoxication


The search for an alcohol antagonist has gone on since the time that ancient Greeks believed that the
precious stone amethyst could block or reverse the intoxicating effects of alcohol; hence the term
"amethystic" agent. Numerous drugs have been tested for this purpose but none has proved to be clinically
useful and intoxication is still treated mainly with supportive care. Many of the agents tested, including
triiodo-thyronine, B vitamins, pyruvate, amino acids, propranolol and amantadine, lacked a clear scientific
rationale and did not provide any practical benefit (Rada & Kellner, 1979; Sellers & Kalant, 1976). More
recent studies have largely focused on agonists or blockers of neuro-transmitter receptors thought to
mediate some of the effects of ethanol. L-dopa, aminophylline and ephedrine were reported to reverse some
of the acute physiological, behavioural and cognitive effects of ethanol (Alkana et al., 1977) but no
confirmatory reports followed (Erickson, 1984). Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as
atipemazole and idazoxan, have also been explored as possible amethystic agents (Lister et al., 1989) but
have not yet been adopted clinically for this purpose. Since they do not have serious side effects, they may
merit further study. Early case reports (Jeffreys, Flanagan, & Volans, 1980) of reversal of ethanol-induced
coma by the opioid antagonist naloxone were not confirmed by subsequent studies (Dole et al., 1982).
Lithium decreased self-reported intoxication and cognitive dysfunction in detoxified alcoholics given
standardized doses of ethanol in a placebo-controlled double-blind study (Judd & Huey, 1989) but these
results, although promising, have not led to the clinical use of lithium for this purpose (Liskow & Goodwin,
1987).


The imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513, a partial inverse agonist at benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors,
partially blocks some of the behavioural effects of alcohol in rats (Le et al., 1989; Lister, 1987; Suzdak et
al., 1986) but the drug is not used clinically for this purpose because it is pro-convulsant in high doses, and
could precipitate seizures in individuals undergoing alcohol withdrawal (Kolata, 1988). Flumazenil (Ro151788), a BZ receptor blocker, has also failed to demonstrate significant reversal of alcohol intoxication in
double-blind placebo-controlled studies (Fluckiger et al., 1988); (Lheureux & Askenasi, 1991). In
preclinical studies, the calcium L-channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine modified some of the
behavioural effects of alcohol (Naranjo & Fan, 1992) but, again, placebo-controlled studies in humans
(Perez-Reyes, White & Hicks, 1992) found that neither of these agents antagonized the effects of alcohol
intoxication on short-term memory or psychomotor performance.


Alcohol affects the release or metabolism of many neurotransmitters and neurohormones, and the activities
of numerous synaptic receptors or "second messenger" systems. There is no valid evidence that any one
of these is the exclusive or dominant mediator of the actions of alcohol. Therefore a single effective and
safe amethystic agent may never be found.


Alcohol withdrawal syndromes


When chronic alcohol intake is abruptly discontinued and blood alcohol levels decrease rapidly, a
characteristic withdrawal reaction emerges. Its severity varies with the intensity and duration of the
preceding alcohol exposure and may be increased in individuals with previous experience of withdrawal
symptoms (Branchey, Rauscher & Kissin, 1971). Mild withdrawal reactions include tremor, anxiety,


WHO/PSN93.10

page 77


insomnia, anorexia and irritability, lasting 48 hours or less. In severe reactions, these symptoms are
accompanied or followed by grand mal seizures or by sweating, tachycardia, fever, disorientation, delusions
and hallucinations ("delirium tremens") (Sellers & Kalant, 1976). Assessment of the alcohol withdrawal
syndrome can be standardized by use of a nine-item scale (Sullivan et al., 1989).


Controlled studies have confirmed that non-pharmacological interventions alone, such as monitoring of
signs and symptoms, personal attention and general nursing care, can substantially reduce the severity of
the withdrawal syndrome (Frecker et al., 1982). Indeed, most patients with mild withdrawal reactions can
be safely managed on an outpatient basis (Hayashida et al., 1989). However, patients in moderate to severe
withdrawal should receive appropriate drug therapy as well (Naranjo & Sellers, 1986). One effective
programme is the benzodiazepine loading dose technique, consisting of administration of 20 mg oral doses
of diazepam hourly until the patient shows clinical improvement or becomes mildly sedated (Sellers et al.,
1983). Dosage is then sharply reduced or stopped, the long half-life of diazepam and its metabolite,
desmethyldiazepam, being sufficient to provide gradually decreasing therapeutic effect over the next day
or two. Many other sedative drugs, including barbiturates, paraldehyde, chlormethiazole and other nonbarbiturates, have been used to treat alcohol withdrawal reactions but on the whole they are not more
effective than the benzodiazepines and some tend to cause excessive drowsiness (Sellers & Kalant, 1976;
Shaw, 1982; Jaffe, Kranzler & Ciraulo, 1992). Phenothiazines and other antipsychotics such as haloperidol
are sometimes used to control hallucinations once the risk of seizures has passed, but because they do not
prevent seizures they are generally not as efficacious as benzodiazepines when used early in the course of
severe withdrawal reactions.


Some of the effects of ethanol may be produced by its inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels
(Carlen & Wu, 1987) and cation channels activated by the NMDA type of glutamate receptor (Gonzales
& Hoffinan, 1991). Accordingly, overactivity of these channels has been found in alcohol withdrawal, and
administration of calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine, nitrendipine) and NMDA receptor antagonists
such as (+)MK-801 can attenuate the withdrawal reaction in rats (Grant et al., 1990; Little, Dolin & Halsey,
1986). Investigation of these drugs for possible use in humans is in progress, although cardiovascular side
effects may limit their use (Naranjo & Fan, 1992). Conversely, ethanol has been shown to activate some
dopaminergic neurons (DeChiara & Imperato, 1988) and some aspects of withdrawal after chronic
excessive intake of alcohol may be associated with reduced dopamine activity. A dopamine receptor
agonist, bromocriptine, has been reported to alleviate some alcohol withdrawal symptoms (Borg &
Weinholdt, 1982) but has not found wide use for this purpose.


Various anticonvulsant agents have been used to prevent or treat alcohol withdrawal seizures. Phenytoin
was commonly employed for this purpose in the past. Carbamazepine and valproic acid are used in
northern Europe but side effects limit their clinical utility (Hillbom et al., 1989), and they do not appear
to have any advantage over benzodiazepines (Jaffe, Kranzler & Ciraulo, 1992; Malcolm et al., 1989).


Several agents that decrease adrenergic activity, including the P-receptor blockers propranolol and atenolol
(Jaffe, Kranzler & Ciraulo, 1992) and the a 2-autoreceptor agonists clonidine and lofexidine, have been
reported to produce rapid improvement in the autonomic symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (Wilkins, Jenkins
& Steiner, 1983). However, these treatments have not been systematically compared with benzodiazepine
therapy and their clinical role is not yet established (Cushman & Sowers, 1989). Other pharmacological
agents that have been tested and, in some cases, incorporated into standard treatments, include magnesium,


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 78


chlormethiazole and bromocriptine (reviewed in Liskow & Goodwin, 1987; Jaffe, Kranzler & Ciraulo,
1992; Castaneda & Cushman, 1989; Litten & Alien, 1991; Romach & Sellers, 1991 ).


Most studies of agents other than benzodiazepines and sedative-hypnotic drugs have suffered from
methodological weaknesses (Moskowitz et al., 1983) that prevent conclusive statements about the clinical
value of these treatments in alcohol withdrawal.


Drugs to decrease alcohol consumption


Pharmacotherapies designed to reduce alcohol intake can be used in two different circumstances: either at
the start of treatment as an aid to reducing the consumption in those individuals who refuse to stop drinking
completely or abruptly, or to prevent later relapse in those who have succeeded in stopping. The role of
pharmacological agents is essentially the same in these two situations and is based on drug actions that (a)
interact with alcohol to produce unconditionally aversive effects (alcohol-sensitizing agents), (b) produce
aversive effects of their own which can be linked conditionally to the presentation of small doses of
alcoholic beverages in order to produce a conditional aversion to alcohol, or (c) interfere with the activation
of the "reward" system by alcohol.


Alcohol-sensitizing agents. Both disulfiram and calcium carbimide inhibit hepatic acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) so that alcohol ingestion is followed by increased blood acetaldehyde levels that
result in flushing, tachycardia, weakness and nausea. These agents differ in their onset and duration of
action (Peachey & Annis, 1985). The effect of disulfiram develops over a period of 12 hours or longer and
lasts for several days, whereas that of calcium carbimide is maximal in 1-2 hours and is largely over in a
day or less (Peachey & Annis, 1985). The alcohol-disulfiram reaction is usually characterized by more
severe hypotension than the alcohol-carbimide reaction. Disulfiram also inhibits dopamine p -hydroxylase
and hepatic cytochrome P450. As a result, chronic treatment with disulfiram increases the elimination halflife of a wide range of drugs that undergo hepatic hydroxylation, including diazepam, desipramine,
phenytoin and warfarin (Banys, 1988; Ciraulo, Barnhill & Boxenbaum, 1985; Hoyumpa & Schenker, 1982;
Sellers, Naranjo & Peachey, 1981). In addition, disulfiram has several contraindications, including liver
disease, heart disease and pregnancy.


Although disulfiram has been used as an alcohol sensitizing agent for over 40 years, there is still no
scientific evidence of its ability to reduce alcohol intake consistently when patients are merely instructed
to ingest it (Fuller et al., 1986; Wright & Moore, 1990). Poor long-term compliance is well recognized as
a problem in its clinical use, even in patients who express willingness to take it. Subcutaneous implants
of disulfiram were developed to overcome this problem but are no more effective than placebo implants
(Wright & Moore, 1990). Calcium carbimide (not sold in the USA) was also no more effective than
placebo in relapse prevention in a short-term double-blind study (Peachey et al., 1989). In addition, the
alcohol-sensitizing drugs can be used only when the treatment goal is abstinence, not partial reduction of
alcohol intake.


Thus, in summary, the alcohol-sensitizing drugs may have a very limited role in the context of a structured
treatment programme in cognitively intact patients who are motivated to remain abstinent, and a somewhat
greater, though ethically problematic, role for those who are required to do so for judicial or other reasons
(Jaffe, Kranzler, & Ciraulo, 1992; Peachey & Annis, 1985; Banys, 1988).


WHO/PSN93.10

page 79


Conditioned aversion therapy. This is essentially a psychologically, rather than a biologically, based
method, since the pharmacological component is limited to the production of a conditional stimulus
identical in role to electric shock or any other aversive stimulus. Therefore this approach is not discussed
here.


Agents to decrease reinforcement of alcohol drinking. Dopaminergic pathways in the brain are widely
recognized to play an important role in reinforcement, both by drugs and by natural reinforcers such as food
and water (Wise, 1987~ Koob & Bloom, 1988). Therefore various dopamine receptor ligands have been
tested for their effects on alcohol consumption. Neuroleptics such as phenothiazines and butyrophenones
block postsynaptic dopamine receptors and, in animal experiments, decrease alcohol consumption.
However, dopamine receptor agonists (e.g., bromocriptine and lisuride) are also reported to decrease
consumption in humans (Borg, 1983~ Dongier, Vachon & Schwartz, 1991) though the possible mechanism
is unclear. More studies are required to establish their possible value.


There is abundant evidence, however, that reinforcement by alcohol and other psychoactive drugs is a very
complex process involving not only dopamine but also opioid peptides, serotonin and probably other
neurotransmitters and modulators (Koob & Bloom, 1988; Kalant, 1989). Numerous studies in both
experimental animals and humans have examined the effects of opioid receptor blockers and serotonin
agonists and antagonists on alcohol consumption. Two recent placebo-controlled double-blind trials
(O'Malley et al., 1992; Volpicelli et al., 1992) indicate that naltrexone, a long-acting opioid receptor
blocker, may help to prevent craving and relapse in detoxified alcoholics. The results were better, however,
if naltrexone was combined with coping skills training and supportive care.


In rodents, serotonin precursors and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors consistently decrease voluntary
intake of ethanol (Naranjo, Sellers & Lawrin, 1986) in a dose-dependent manner by up to 60% or more.
In humans, the effects have been much less dramatic. Zimelidine, a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, reduced alcohol
intake in mildly to moderately alcohol-dependent subjects to whom it was given in placebo-controlled
double-blind studies (Amit & Smith, 1992; Naranjo et al., 1984). The reduction in total intake during the
study period was modest (about 20%) and resulted mainly from a decrease in the number of drinking days
rather than a major decrease in intake on drinking days. Similar results have been described with other
serotonin uptake inhibitors, including citalopram (Naranjo et al., 1992), viqualine (Naranjo et al., 1989),
and fluoxetine (Gorelick & Paredes, 1992; Naranjo et al., 1990) and with the serotonin 1A agonist buspirone
(Bruno, 1989). Somewhat surprisingly, certain serotonin receptor antagonists also decrease alcohol intake
modestly inhuman subjects. For example, ritanserin (a 5-HT2 blocker) and ondansetron (a 5-HT3 blocker)
decreased the desire to drink and reduced the intake per drinking day (Monti & Alterwain, 1991; Sellers
et al., 1991). Studies with fluvoxamine, ritanserin, ondansetron and other agents are continuing. However,
all of the trials with these agents have been of short duration (3-8 weeks), and the effects, as noted, have
been modest A very recent placebo-controlled double-blind study revealed no effect ofbuspirone on either
alcohol consumption or anxiety during a 25-week follow-up of 67 anxious alcoholics treated with buspirone
(Malcolm et al., 1992). Therefore the role, if any, of these agents in the long-term management of
alcoholism, and especially in the prevention of relapse, is not yet clear.


Similar uncertainty applies to other pharmacotherapeutic agents that have been tested. Lithium was
reported to decrease the desire to drink alcohol and the amount consumed (Judd & Huey, 1989) but a
number of controlled clinical trials in alcoholics have failed to establish a role for lithium in the treatment


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 80


of alcoholism (Dorus et al., 1989; Pond et al., 1981). Acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurinate), an
agonist at gamma-aminobutyrate [GABA] receptors has also been reported to reduce the relapse rate in
detoxified alcoholics (Lhuintre et al., 1990; Pelc et al., 1992), as has the GABA metabolite gammahydroxybutyrate (Galimberti et al., 1992). Enalapril and captopril, two angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors, reduced alcohol consumption in rats (Grupp, Spinosa & Lingham, 1992) but had no significant
effects in humans (Naranjo et al., 1991).


The results described above indicate that it is possible for pharmacotherapeutic agents to affect the
reinforcing properties of alcohol, but until we have a fuller knowledge of the mechanisms of reinforcement
it is unlikely that any single one of these agents will play a major role in the treatment of alcoholism. For
the present, they can be regarded at best as a supplement to cognitive or behavioural approaches (Annis,

1990).


Medical complications of heavy drinking


Chronic heavy consumption of alcohol can cause cell necrosis in various organs, including brain, liver,
pancreas and skeletal and cardiac muscle. However, only in liver has the mechanism of cytotoxicity been
clarified sufficiently to give rise to clinically useful pharmacotherapies. Chronic alcohol consumption has
been shown to increase the oxygen requirement in liver (Israel et al., 1979), thus increasing the risk of
perivenous hypoxia. Short-tenn administration of the antithyroid drug propylthiouracil (PTU) reduced the
hepatic oxygen requirement (Israel et al., 197 5) and improved various clinical and laboratoty indices of liver
function (Orrego et al., 1979). A long-term double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of PTU therapy reduced
the two-year cumulative mortality by 48% in the whole PTU group and by more than 60% in the more
seriously liver-damaged subjects (Orrego et al., 1987). Acetaldehyde, derived from the metabolism of
ethanol, has been shown to damage the microtubulin assemblies that are necessaty for mitosis and various
other cell functions (Tuma, Smith & Sorrell, 1991 ). Colchicine, which arrests microtubule formation and
cell division, has recently been reported to produce beneficial results in alcoholic liver disease, similar to
those ofPTU (Kershenobich et al., 1988).


MEDICATIONS FOR SEDATIVE/ANXIOLYTIC DEPENDENCE


Dependence on therapeutic as well as high doses ofbenzodiazepines is well documented (Busto et al., 1986;
Busto et al., 1986; Owen & Tyrer, 1983; Petursson & Lader, 1981; Rickels et al., 1990; Roy-Byrne &
Hammer, 1988). It is characterized by a distinctive withdrawal syndrome (Smith & Wesson, 1991) that
includes paresthesias, tinnitus (Busto et al., 1986; Roy-Byrne & Hommer, 1988; Busto, Naranjo &
Fornazzari, 1988), anxiety, sleep disturbances (Rickets et al., 1990; Covi et al., 1973), seizures,
hallucinations and disorientation (Robinson & Sellers, 1982). The pattern and severity of the withdrawal
syndrome depend on the daily dose, the duration of use and the elimination kinetics of the specific BZ used:
those with short half-lives are associated with more risk of severe withdrawal reactions than those with long
half-lives (Busto & Sellers, 1986). The problem of diagnosis is complicated by the fact that many BZdependent patients also abuse other drugs such as alcohol and opiates (Busto, Simpkins & Sellers, 1983;
Stitzer et al., 1981; World Health Organization, 1982). Withdrawal syndromes caused by older sedativehypnotic drugs such as barbiturates, glutethimide or methaqualone, resemble those due to alcohol and to
BZs. The occasions for pharmacotherapy are summarized below.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 81


Intoxication


Benzodiazepine overdose is rarely severe and can usually be managed with supportive care alone. If
necessary, however, BZ intoxication can be reversed by the BZ receptor antagonist, flumazenil (Ciraulo et
al., 1991). As with alcohol, there is no specific antagonist available to reverse the effects of the older
hypnotics and only supportive care is available even though these substances are more likely than the BZs
to produce lethal intoxication (Ciraulo et al., 1991).


Physical dependence and withdrawal


The BZ withdrawal syndrome usually resolves spontaneously and without major complications (Busto et
al., 1986; Owen & Tyrer, 1983; Petursson & Lader, 1981; Rickels 1990; Roy-Byrne & Hommer, 1988)
unless seizures develop. There is no widely accepted treatment strategy and there are no controlled studies
comparing the various strategies that have been proposed (Smith & Wesson, 1991; Ciraulo et al., 1991;
Alexander & Perry, 1991; Sullivan & Sellers, 1986). Most patients who have used BZs for less than 12
weeks are managed by gradual reduction of dosage and replacement of the previously used BZ by a
medication which has a long elimination half-life and which exhibits cross-tolerance with the offending
drug. Thus, diazepam (tYl(~ )=40h), desmethyldiazepam (tYl(~ )=70h) and phenobarbital (tYl(P )=100h)
are frequently used for this purpose (Ciraulo et al., 1991; Sullivan & Sellers, 1986) in dosages equivalent
to those of the drugs that are being replaced. One recommended strategy is to administer a loading dose
equivalent to about 50% of the reported daily dose of the BZ and then reduce the dose gradually to zero by
decrements of 5-20% per day (Ciraulo et al., 1991; Alexander & Perry, 1991; Sullivan & Sellers, 1986).


A variety of other medications that do not have the reinforcing effects of BZs (e.g., buspirone, imipramine,
carbamazepine, clonidine, propranolol, fluoxetine) have been used as alternative treatments in BZ
withdrawal and for alleviation of re-emerging psychiatric symptoms for which the BZ was originally
prescribed (Ciraulo et al., 1991; Rickels et al., 1990; Tyrer, Rutherford & Huggett, 1981; Lader & Olajide,
1987). However, the results are inconsistent (Smith & Wesson, 1991; Alexander & Perry, 1991; Lader &
Olajide, 1987; Schweizer, Case & Rickels, 1986).


Signs and symptoms of the barbiturate/sedative withdrawal syndrome are quite similar to those described
above, except that withdrawal from high doses of short-acting agents is more likely to produce postural
hypotension, hyperthermia, grand mal seizures and delirium (Jaffe, 1990). The most usual treatment
strategies are either gradual reduction of the daily dose of the drug in question (Ciraulo et al., 1991; Jaffe,

1990), a substitution of phenobarbital followed by a gradual reduction in phenobarbital dosage (Smith &
Wesson, 1971), or a loading-dose strategy similar to that described for BZ withdrawal but using
phenobarbital. The latter is given every hour in doses of 120 mg until signs of intoxication (nystagmus,
dysarthria, ataxia, etc.) appear (Sellers, 1988). No further doses are given, because the long half-life of
phenobarbital guarantees that from that point on there will be a gradual reduction in plasma level over the
next 15 days.


Relapse prevention


Despite successful withdrawal, as many as 50% ofBZ or other hypnosedative users relapse within one year
(Arora, Knight & Busto, 1991). There is no specific pharmacotherapy to prevent this and reliance is usually
placed on psychological interventions and support.


WHO/PSA/93.10

MEDICATIONS FOR NICOTINE DEPENDENCE


Public awareness of the health effects of tobacco use has increased substantially through the years.
Smoking cessation has major and immediate health benefits for men and women of all ages, regardless of
the presence or not of a smoking-related disease.


Although it has been estimated that 90% of former smokers quit without using smoking cessation
programmes, counselling or nicotine replacement therapies, smokers who do need this assistance should
have access to it. Smoking cessation materials and programmes, nicotine replacement therapies, exercise,
stress management and dietmy counselling can help smokers cope with nicotine withdrawal symptoms until
they abate, after which favourable psychological changes are likely to occur. Behavioural intervention
should be recognized as the most successful means of smoking cessation.


Nicotine replacement therapies are most suitable for the relief of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in the
physically dependent smoker, rather than for the treatment of psychological components of dependence.
However, nicotine replacement therapy is expensive for the consumer and is thus unsuitable for most
smokers in developing countries.


Cigarette smoking produces nicotine tolerance, dependence and withdrawal reactions in a high proportion
of regular smokers, thus meeting the DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for psychoactive substance abuse
disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1987). Pharmacologic treatment strategies are aimed at
relieving nicotine withdrawal symptoms, decreasing craving and managing weight gain and psychiatric
problems that may develop following withdrawal. Because the management of nicotine withdrawal is
usually intended as the first step in smoking cessation, the same medications are used for both purposes.
All these pharmacotherapies are more efficacious when used as adjuncts to behavioural or psychological
treatment (T onnesen et al., 1988).


Nicotine intoxication


Life-threatening nicotine intoxication is almost always the result of oral or percutaneous absorption of
highly concentrated nicotine solutions used as insecticides (Benowitz, 1988). Intoxication due to tobacco
smoking or chewing is usually mild and of short duration because of the rapid development of tolerance and
the short half-life of nicotine. Antagonists such as mecamylamine are available but are rarely used.


Nicotine withdrawal and reduction of tobacco use


The characteristic symptoms of nicotine withdrawal include irritability, frustration, anger, anxiety, difficulty
in concentrating, restlessness, decreased heart rate, increased appetite and weight gain, and strong craving
for nicotine (American Psychiatric Association, 1987; Benowitz, 1988), although 90% offormer smokers
quit without using nicotine replacement therapy and behavioural intervention should be recognized as the
most successful means of smoking cessation. To date, the most effective pharmacotherapy is nicotine
replacement; a secondary role is assigned to non-nicotine treatment of the actual withdrawal symptoms,
weight gain or psychiatric problems such as depression which may emerge in some smokers following
cessation (Glass man & Covey, 1990).


Nicotine replacement


This process uses a less addictive, less hazardous and more manageable preparation of nicotine than
tobacco itself, such as nicotine-containing chewing gum or transdermal patches. These vehicles do not


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 83


contain tar or other products of tobacco combustion and prevent the hazards of second-hand smoke to nonsmokers (Janerich, Thompson & Varela, 1990). Nicotine gum is more efficacious than placebo gum when
it is used in specialized clinics and in programmes providing proper instruction in its use (T ennesen et al.,
1988; Glassman & Covey, 1990; Lam et al., 1987) but benefits seen in general medical practices are small
(Lam et al., 1987). The effectiveness of nicotine gum seems to depend upon characteristics of the patient,
the degree of compliance, the type of behavioural intervention that is used in conjunction with the gum and
the instructions given with the gum.


One concern is that nicotine gum may simply substitute for tobacco in maintaining nicotine dependence.
However, the chewing effort required to extract the nicotine, the unpleasant taste of the gum, side effects
and the absence of peak blood nicotine levels appear to limit its potential for abuse (Benowitz, 198 8; Sees,
1990). Side effects include sore throat or mouth, hiccups, tired jaws and nausea. These may be partially
controlled by chewing more slowly and not swallowing the nicotine laden saliva (Benowitz, 1988).
Aerosols and nasal drops have been explored as alternative methods of nicotine delivery (Glassman &
Covey, 1990) but they can produce nasal irritation and may cause embarrassment when used in public, they
are absorbed very rapidly through the nasal mucosa and reach the brain in about 30 seconds, thus
reproducing the initial satisfaction of a cigarette. These may prove hard to give up for precisely this reason.


Another widely used nicotine replacement preparation is the transdermal patch. This system provides
controlled and continuous delivery of nicotine which is absorbed through the skin into the systemic
circulation. Several placebo-controlled trials (reviewed in Palmer, Buckley & Faulds, 1992) have assessed
the therapeutic efficacy of this method, both with and without concurrent counselling or behaviour therapy,
in smokers who wished to stop smoking. The addition of counselling or behaviour therapy raised the
abstinence rates to 35-61% (Palmer, Buckley & Faulds, 1992). The most common side effect was skin
irritation. Currently, nicotine patches are available for 16-hour and 24-hour daily application for up to 20
weeks. Longer-term use is not advised.


Treatment of major withdrawal symptoms


The second therapeutic approach, symptomatic treatment of major withdrawal symptoms (anxiety,
irritability, restlessness, tension), has had some short-term success in smoking cessation. Clonidine, an oc 2noradrenergic autoreceptor agonist that inhibits presynaptic release of noradrenaline, was reported to be
significantly more effective than placebo, with or without behavioural counselling (Glassman & Covey,

1990), but later work suggests that it is helpful only with female smokers. Its side effects, such as postural
hypotension, dizziness, lethargy and dry mouth, may limit its use in many patients (Sees, 1990). Combined
therapy with decreasing doses of nicotine gum and transdermal clonidine has been developed but has not
yet been evaluated adequately (Sees, 1990).


Nicotine increases the release of P -endorphin, norepinephrine and dopamine (Pomerleau & Pomerleau,
1984); the release of the latter may contribute to its euphoriant effect. Chronic use is postulated to result
in adaptive decreases in release of these neurotransmitters, so that a deficiency of them occurs during
nicotine withdrawal which may account for aspects of the negative mood state during smoking cessation.
Pharmacotherapies that alleviate depression and anxiety may improve a patient's ability to concentrate on
behavioural treatment (Glassman & Covey, 1990; Sees, 1990). Buspirone was reported to be more
effective than placebo m relieving affective symptoms of nicotine withdrawal (Hilleman et al., 1992).
Fluoxetine and D-fenflurarnine prevented the overeating and weight gain that usually accompany smoking
cessation but did not decrease the number of cigarettes smoked (Pomerleau, Spring & Pomerleau, 1992;
Spring et al., 1991).


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 84


Blockade therapy and deterrent therapy


Both these therapies have also been tested as aids to reduction of tobacco use. Blockade therapy consists
of administration of a nicotinic receptor blocker which should prevent the reinforcing effects of nicotine and
thus decrease the motivation for its use. A small clinical trial of the ganglionic blocking agent
mecamylamine given in conjunction with counselling suggested some utility (Tennant, Tarver & Rawson,
1983) but there have been no further positive reports of the clinical usefulness of blockade therapy.
Deterrent therapy employs pharmacological substances that interact with inhaled nicotine to produce
aversive effects. Silver acetate, in gums or lozenges, reacts with sulfides in tobacco smoke to produce
sulfide salts that are extremely distasteful (Sees, 1990; Jarvik & Henningfield, 1988). Non-compliance is
a major problem in its clinical use.


Relapse prevention


More than 80% of smokers fail to quit smoking on their first attempt and, even after seven attempts, more
than half return to smoking (Sees, 1990). Of those who, with the aid of nicotine patches, succeed in
quitting, about half relapse in 6-12 months (Palmer, Buckley & Faulds, 1992). Pharmacotherapies that
alleviate symptoms of co-existing psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression may decrease the
risk of relapse (Glassman & Covey, 1990; Jarvik & Henningfield, 1988). However, emphasis on the
improved health and feelings of well-being that result from smoking cessation is probably the most effective
means of preventing relapse.


Medical complications


Cigarette smoking is recognized as the leading cause of preventable death in many countries. It is a major
risk factor for coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, lung and other cancers, chronic laryngitis
and bronchitis, and fetal damage, to name a few of the many medical complications (Benowitz, 1988; Sees,
1990). However, these problems are treated according to current medical practices for them rather than by
any pharmacotherapies specific to the role of smoking in their causation.


MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID DEPENDENCE


Opioids include natural opiates derived from opium (e.g., morphine and codeine), semisynthetic derivatives
of these (e.g., heroin) and wholly synthetic drugs such as pethidine (meperidine) and methadone. All these
agents bind to the same receptors as the endogenous opioid peptides (P-endorphin, enkephalins and
dynorphin) that act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the central nervous system. Antagonists,
such as naloxone ornaltrexone, block these same receptors and prevent the actions ofboth the exogenous
opioid drugs and the endogenous opioid peptides. Recent advances in neurobiology of the opioids have
provided a rational basis for the development of additional pharmacotherapies for opioid intoxication and
withdrawal (Kosten, 1990), as described below.


Intoxication


The characteristic signs of opioid overdose include coma, slow shallow respiration, pin-point pupils, pallor
and sometimes pulmonary ederna. Death results from prolonged apnea. Treatment consists of the provision
of adequate ventilation and the intravenous administration of naloxone. Repeated small doses (0.2-0.4 mg)
are given until the patient returns to consciousness and shows signs of opioid withdrawal. However, the


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 85


duration of action of naloxone is brief and repeated doses may be required by patients intoxicated with longacting opioids such as methadone (Ling & Wesson, 1990; Jaffe & Martin, 1990).


Withdrawal syndrome


The opioid withdrawal syndrome includes anxiety, runny nose, lacrimation, sweating, nausea, diarrhea,
vomiting, muscle pains, piloerection, insomnia and craving for the drug (Kosten, 1990; Ling & Wesson,

1990; Jaffe, Epstein & Ciraulo, 1991). This syndrome, though uncomfortable, is not usually lifethreatening for healthy adults, and many patients who are not severely dependent are able to stop opioid use
abruptly ("cold turkey") without therapy. However, the symptoms can be alleviated rapidly by
administration of either J.l-receptor agonists or partial agonists. Methadone, a pure J.l-agonist, is the

tr~tment of choice and the standard against which other pharmacotherapies are measured. Oral methadone
is substituted for the abused opioid, initially in equivalent dosage to the opioid being used, and then in
gradually decreasing doses over a period of days or weeks (Jaffe, 1990; Ling & Wesson, 1990). For
outpatient treatment of withdrawal, L-alpha acetylmethadol (L-AAM), a longer-acting equivalent, has the
advantage that it can be given every second day rather than daily but in terms of ultimate opioid abstinence
it is not more effective than methadone (Jaffe, Epstein & Ciraulo, 1991 ). Buprenorphine, a partial J.lagonist, also suppresses the full range of opioid withdrawal symptoms, can be given sub lingually and has
also been used to manage opioid withdrawal on both outpatient and inpatient basis (Johnson, Jaffe &
Fudala, 1992; Kosten & Kleber, 1988).


Clonidine and other a 2-adrenoceptor agonists are also effective in alleviating those opioid withdrawal
symptoms that are due to adrenergic overactivity, including some of the distressing autonomic disturbances
(Kosten, 1990). Although some reports have indicated clonidine to be as effective as methadone in
relieving opioid withdrawal symptoms (Kleber et al., 1985), other reports found it less effective (San et al.,
1989). The results probably depend on the outcome measures used: gooseflesh, runny nose and watery eyes
are relieved by clonidine, but diarrhea, muscle aches, insomnia, craving and anorexia are not (Jasinski,
Johnson & Kocher, 1985). Some of the side effects (hypotension and sedation) limit the maximum dose
of clonidine that can be used in outpatient treatment. The greater success of clonidine in inpatient therapy
may be related to the higher doses that can be used, as well as the supportive care provided in an inpatient
setting (Kleber et al., 1985). Other a 2-adrenergic agonists, such as guanfacine, lofexidine and guanabenz,
seem to be as effective as clonidine and have less hypotensive and sedative effect (Herridge & Gold, 1988)
but do not seem to have stimulated much research.


Protracted withdrawal syndrome and relapse prevention


Although the phenomenon has been described in relation to other types of drug dependence, opioid
dependence is especially noted for the persistence of subtle physiological and psychological abnormalities
for many weeks after the signs and symptoms of acute withdrawal have subsided. It may take six to nine
months or more of total abstinence to restore normal mood, sleep patterns, basal metabolic rate,
temperature, respiration and blood pressure (Martin et al., 1988). When patients who have been maintained
on high doses of methadone are withdrawn, these persistent disturbances are associated over a period of
months with frequent episodes of craving, mood !ability and a high vulnerability to relapse (Dole, 1988;
Ball & Ross, 1991; Cushman & Dole, 1973). Two types of pharmacotherapy, methadone maintenance and
naltrexone blockade, are used to deal with this problem.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 86


Methadone maintenance


Methadone maintenance therapy is used in opioid-dependent subjects who are unwilling or unable to stop
their opioid use completely and are likely to relapse to illicit heroin use. Methadone is administered orally,
once a day, in dosage initially equivalent to that of the previously self-administered drug. In the best
documented protocol, the dose is then gradually increased by about 10 mg a week to a dose of 60 to 100
mg/day. At this dose patients are very tolerant to exogenous opioids and experience no euphoria when they
inject illicitopioids (Dole, 1988; Kreek, 1992). In some programmes this dose level is then maintained for
months or years in order to reduce illicit opioid use, reduce parenteral injection (a major concern in relation
to AIDS and hepatitis) and to achieve improved health and psychosocial functioning (Dole, 1988; Kreek,
1992; Zweben & Payte, 1990). In other programmes, the dose is reduced over a period of up to six months
to the lowest dose that maintains the patient free of withdrawal symptoms (Dole, 1988; Zweben & Payte,
1990). Some programmes, on philosophical grounds, rarely prescribe doses higher than 40 mg per day,
despite repeated findings that higher doses are more effective in reducing heroin use and preventing
premature termination of treatment (Dole, 1988; Ball & Ross, 1991).


Buprenorphine and L-AAM are still under investigation as alternatives to methadone in this type of
maintenance therapy (Jaffe & Martin, 1990; Johnson, Jaffe & Fudala, 1992; Zweben & Payte, 1990; Fudala
et al., 1990; Resnick, Galanter, Pycha et al., 1992; Kosten, Morgan & Kleber, 1990). L-AAM, which needs
to be administered only three times per week, appears to be as effective as methadone and is expected to
be approved for use in the USA in the near future. Buprenorphine has been shown to suppress heroin use
in volunteers in laboratory settings (Mello & Mendelson, 1980) and to be equivalent to methadone in
reducing heroin use and retaining patients in treatment in outpatient settings (Johnson, Jaffe & Fudala,
1992; Resnick, Galanter, Pycha et al., 1992; Kosten, Morgan & Kleber, 1990). Success at remaining
abstinent after cessation of methadone maintenance depends in part upon the adaptive changes (e.g., new
job skills, social skills, drug-free friendships, recreational activities) made during the maintenance period
(Ball & Ross, 1991; Zweben & Payte, 1990) and the capacity to cope with protracted abstinence which
varies considerably in intensity from patient to patient (Dole, 1988; Cushman & Dole, 1973; Kreek, 1992).


Naltrexone maintenance


N altrexone maintenance therapy is based on the ability of orally administered naltrexone, a long-acting
opioid receptor blocker, to block all the effects of opioids, including the reinforcing effects. The abstinent
individual who tries heroin or another active opioid while on naltrexone therapy will experience no euphoria
and, after several such experiences, should lose the craving for heroin (Jaffe & Martin, 1990; Herridge &
Gold, 1988). An opioid-free period is necessary before the start ofnaltrexone therapy in order to avoid the
precipitation of withdrawal symptoms. The sequential combination of clonidine or buprenorphine with
naltrexone eliminates the need for this 5-l 0 day interval, during which relapse frequently occurs, and offers
a rapid and effective means of withdrawal from heroin or methadone (Kosten & Kleber, 1988; Herridge &
Gold, 1988; Zweben& Payte, 1990; Charney, Heninger& Kleber, 1986; Stine & Kosten, 1992). However,
naltrexone may produce some degree of dysphoria because of its blockade of the actions of endogenous
opioid pep tides and is not well accepted by some groups of opioid users (Ling & Wesson, 1990; J affe &
Martin, 1990). Concomitant treatment with fluoxetine has been reported to improve retention in a
naltrexone maintenance programme (Maremmani et al., 1992).


Medical complications


The great majority of medical complications of opioid use are secondary to the intravenous use of drugs and
can be prevented by methadone maintenance which sharply suppresses intravenous use of heroin (Dole,


WHO/PSA/93.1 0

page 87


1988; Ball & Ross, 1991; Kreek, 1992; Zweben & Payte, 1990; Cooper, 1989). Treatment for these
complications follows the prevalent medical practice and is independent of the role of opioid use in
producing them.


COCAINE AND OTHER PSYCHOSTIMULANT DEPENDENCE


Cocaine, like amphetamine and its congeners, initially increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine
free in the synapses by either blocking their reuptake (cocaine) or stimulating their release (amphetamine).
The increase in dopamine is believed to be responsible for the initial euphoria, hyperarousal and the
paranoid delusions, while increases in other catecholamines and neurotransmitters are probably linked to
toxicity and other acute effects (Thadani, 1991). However, prolonged increases in catecholamines and other
transmitters result in adaptive changes such as increased transmitter metabolism by catechol-0methyltransferase, decreased biosynthesis from tyrosine, receptor down-regulation or other intracellular
alterations. If the stimulant is then stopped, dysphoria, depression, profound sleepiness and other
withdrawal symptoms occur (Biaine & Ling, 1992; Gawin & Ellinwood, 1988).


Intoxication


The major patterns of serious intoxication with cocaine or other psychostimulants reflect the actions of
excess neurotransmitters (catecholamines, serotonin) in various systems or, in some cases, the local
anesthetic effects of cocaine (Cregler & Mark, 1986; Hall, Talbert & Ereshefsky, 1990; Benowitz, 1992).
The choice of therapy depends upon the Qresenting pattern of toxicity. Perhaps the most frequent form
requiring pharmacotherapy is excessive behavioural excitation with paranoid delusions, stereotypy and
violence. These symptoms respond to neuroleptic agents that have both dopamine and norepinephrine
blocking action. Severe tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia and the risk of ventricular arrhythmias or
intracranial hemorrhage are usually treated with P-adrenergic blockers and conventional medication for
acute hypertension. More cardiac specific P 1 blockers, such as metoprolol, should reduce the possibility
of aggravating hypertension associated with blocking p receptors on blood vessels but leaving _a_ receptors
unaffected (Benowitz, 1992). Grand mal seizures generally respond to diazepam (Roehrich & Gold, 1991).
Respiratory depression requires maintenance of adequate ventilation until the drug concentration falls by
metabolism to levels that are not life-threatening. In animals, J.L-agonist opioids reduce cocaine lethality
(Witkin et al., 1991) and calcium channel blockers attenuate cocaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity
(Trouve & Nahas, 1986). The latter have been proposed as having clinical utility.


Withdrawal syndrome and relapse prevention


After prolonged use of cocaine or amphetamines in high doses, abrupt withdrawal gives rise to a picture
that is generally opposite to that produced by these agents acutely. The characteristic symptoms are
depression, fatigue, deep sleep, excessive appetite (Gawin & Ellinwood, 1988; Dackis et al., 1985; Kalant,
1972) and a craving for the drug that frequently leads to renewed use (Herridge & Gold, 1988). Generally
these symptoms resolve within 10 to 14 days without any specific intervention although some measures of
brain function may not recover for many weeks (Weddington et al., 1990). Even if withdrawal is initially
successful, the recurrence of craving in response to drug-linked conditional stimuli may lead to later relapse.


Several of the proposed pharmacotherapies for withdrawal are based on the hypothesis that the withdrawal
symptoms and craving result from the depletion of dopamine in the brain or decreased sensitivity to
dopamine (Dackis et al., 1985; Koob, 1992). These treatments for cocaine withdrawal are postulated to
involve low-level replacement with agents that mimic the acute actions of cocaine, somewhat analogous to


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 88


methadone maintenance therapy for heroin addicts. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine and
pergolide, as well as amantadine which releases dopamine, have been reported to reduce withdrawal
symptoms and/or craving for cocaine (Hall, Talbert & Ereshefsky, 1990; Dackis, Gold, Davies & Sweeney,
1985; Taylor & Gold, 1990; Tennant & Sagherian, 1987; Malcolm et al., 1991; Wilkin, 1990) but there
is as yet no firm evidence that such agents significantly alter the likelihood of success in completing cocaine
withdrawal, or reduce cocaine use or prevent relapse in the outpatient treatment of cocaine dependence
(Jaffe, 1991). Flupenthixol, a dopamine receptor blocker, has also been reported to reduce craving for
cocaine, possibly by blocking presynaptic autoreceptors and thus increasing the release of dopamine from
the presynaptic terminals (Gawin, Alien & Humblestone, 1989) but as yet there have been no positive
reports from studies using flupenthixol that employed appropriate controls.


Tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine and imipramine have also been tried, initially because of their
capacity to block reuptake of catecholamines and their antidepressant effects (Gawin & Ellinwood, 1988;
Hall, Talbert & Ereshefsky, 1990; Taylor & Gold, 1990; Wilkin, 1990; Kosten, 1989). Lithium has also
been used (Taylor & Gold, 1990; Kosten, 1989; Gawin, Kleber, Byck, Rounsaville, Kosten, Jatlow &
Morgan, 1989). While desipramine was reported to be helpful in decreasing craving in several uncontrolled
studies and in decreasing cocaine use in one double-blind study ( Gawin et al., 1989), several well controlled
studies oftricyclic agents showed no beneficial effects (Taylor & Gold, 1990; Weddington et al., 1991;
Meyer, 1992). There is now a consensus that lithium is useful only for subjects with dysthymic or bipolar
disorder (Kosten, 1989).


In animal studies, frequent repetition of the same dose of cocaine leads to increasing psychomotor excitation
and ultimately to seizures; this has been compared to the phenomenon of "kindling" of seizures by repeated
subthreshold electrical stimuli. On this basis, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine has been tested for
treatment of cocaine withdrawal (Halikas & Kuhn, 1990; Halikas et al., 1992) but the results are
inconclusive. Other agents that have been tested include gepirone, a 5-HT 1A agonist with anxiolytic effects
(Jenkins et al., 1992), fluoxetine (Wilkin, 1990; Pollack & Rosenbaum, 1991) and bupropion (Margolin
et al., 1991; Hollister et al., 1992). In monkeys, buprenorphine suppresses cocaine self-administration
without reducing responding for food reward (Mello, Mendelson & Bree, 1989). Other opioid
agonist/antagonists (e.g., butorphanol and nalbuphine) do not show a selective effect (Mello et al., 1993).
In non-randomized non-blind studies, opioid dependent patients treated with buprenorphine used less
cocaine than patients maintained on methadone (Kosten, Kleber & Morgan, 1989) but, in a double-blind
random assignment study of opiate dependent patients, no difference in cocaine use was observed between
patients on methadone and those on buprenorphine (Johnson, Jaffe & Fudala, 1992).


These studies raise a number of important issues that must be taken into account in the evaluation of
pharmacotherapies for cocaine dependence, just as for the other types of dependence discussed above.
These include: the degree of compliance with the treatment regimen; inpatient versus outpatient
programmes; degree of success of the double-blind procedure used; nature of the patient sample (e.g.,
cocaine only, versus combined abuse of cocaine and opioids); duration of treatment and follow-up; the
outcome measures used (self-reports of craving or cocaine use versus tests for cocaine in blood or urine
specimens obtained under supervision); and the efficacy of concomitant non-pharmacological treatments
used (Jaffe, 1991; Meyer, 1992; Margolin, Kosten & Avants, 1992).


Medical complications


The medical complications of stimulant use are essentially those of acute drug toxicity and of route of
administration (Cregler & Mark, 1986; Benowitz, 1992; Pollack, Brotman & Rosenbaum, 1989). These
problems and their respective pharmacotherapies have been dealt with above.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 89


**BIOLOGICALLY BASED THERAPIES OTHER THAN PHARMACOTHERAPIES**


In some countries, considerable importance is given to physical therapies of various kinds, but generally
without a clear or testable theoretical basis. Among these may be mentioned acupuncture, transcranial
electrical stimulation of the brain, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and cranial cryotherapy (Vrublevsky &
Voronin, unpublished document prepared for WHO). A suggested rationale for acupuncture and
transcranial electrostimulation is the stimulation of release of endogenous opioids such as enkephalins or

p -endorphin, which would presumably compensate for downregulation of activity in the endogenous opioid
systems as a result of chronic drug use. There is little or no empirical evidence to support this hypothesis,
however, and a notable lack of suitably controlled studies to assess the efficacy of the proposed therapies.


**CONCLUSION**


A wide range of pharmacotherapies have been used or tested for the treatment of all aspects of dependence
on psychoactive substances. Some of these are based on very sound and specific knowledge of the
mechanisms of action of the various substances (e.g., the use of specific receptor blockers for reversing the
effects of opioid overdose, or nicotine replacement therapy in smokers undergoing withdrawal). Others are
based on incomplete knowledge and only partially substantiated hypotheses (e.g., the use of serotonin
uptake inhibitors or dopamine receptor ligands of various kinds for reduction of the desire to drink alcohol
or take other drugs). By and large, therefore, the acceptance or rejection of proposed therapies must rest
largely on empirical evidence gathered in carefully designed clinical trials with suitable controls and
appropriately chosen response measures. Most studies to date have not met these requirements and there
is a continuing need for clinical trials of high quality (Meyer, 1992). Finally, it must be recognized that
most pharmacotherapies available at present are of limited efficacy and should be used as components of
comprehensive programmes in which cognitive, behavioural and social interventions play an equal or
greater role.

**V.** **PSYCHOLOGICAL, BEHAVIOURAL AND PSYCHODYNAMIC**

**TREATMENTS FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE**


**INTRODUCTION**


The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the psychological and behavioural treatments for substance abuse
and to define them operationally. In deciding how to present this information, we considered two different
approaches. Firstly, we could use broad descriptors such as "relapse prevention" or "cognitive behaviour
therapy" and attempt to defme the content of what occurs in those treatments. The difficulty with this
approach is that many clinicians have differing ideas about what constitutes treatment such as "relapse
prevention". In other words, there is not always consensus on the content of a labelled treatment. An
alternative approach is to describe components of treatment we can operationally defme, knowing that they
are often combined with others. We realize that combinations of basic components may yield efficacy
which is greater than the swn of their component parts. Our primary objective, however, is to describe the
various treatment components, not to review the treatment outcome literature. [Readers more interested
in the outcome might wish to consult Miller & Hester (1986)]. Our solution to the quandary of how to
present this information is to rely largely on the latter "components" approach except where there appears
to be consensus on the critical elements of more complex interventions.


This chapter is organized to conform to the classification scheme presented in the chapter on _Descriptors_
_of Treatment Responses,_ to provide a database type of format. We have divided the modality type of
"psychological" treatments into three sections -cognitive, behavioural and psychodynamic- to provide
some logical grouping of the various strategies. We have added a section called format which indicates
whether a treatment is provided on an individual basis, on a group basis, or both.


The information is in tabular form. The table includes data in the areas of stage specificity, setting, target,
format, provider, time frame, cost and availability. A caveat is in order regarding our discussions in the
areas of stage specificity, setting, target, time frame, cost and availability for in many instances hard data
are not available and the mformation represents our best guesses. We hope this project will provide the data
to make necessary modifications.


In the discussions of efficacy, the categories developed by Holder and his colleagues (Holder, et al., 1991)
have been adapted wherever possible. These categories start with good evidence and range across fair,
indeterminate, no evidence and insufficient evidence of effectiveness. These summary categories reflect
the overall results of controlled or comparative studies. Because of the inherent weaknesses in anecdotal
evidence, it is not discussed here. Treatments supported by nothing more than anecdotal evidence have been
classed as insufficient evidence. We also have used the cost estimates presented in Holder et al., 1991
whenever possible.


Finally, the word "client" is used to describe individuals with alcohol and/or drug problems who are either
presenting for treatment or are receiving treatment.

PSYCHOLOGICAL MODALITIES: COGNITIVE
STRATEGIES FOR ESTABLISHING A THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP


The most common first steps in the rehabilitation stages of treatment involve establishing a therapeutic
relationship with the client. This is often where the environment of and expectations about treatment are
established. We have also included assessment here as a treatment component because of growing
awareness that assessment may influence outcome independently of other treatment components.


Empathic/reflective listening


Many therapists use empathic responses and reflective listening to develop rapport with clients. Here the
therapist does not give advice but listens carefully to the client and attempts to understand by paraphrasing
and restating what the client is saying. If the client displays or reports emotions, the therapist reflects those
feelings back to the client. For example, if the client appears angry, the therapist might say, "You seem
quite angry about what's happened".


Self-disclosure


Another way therapists establish a therapeutic relationship is through self-disclosure. By telling the client
relevant information about himself or herself, the therapist shows the client that they have something in
common. This also may help the client to see the therapist as experienced and competent. To this end, the
therapist might relate the story of his or her own addiction and recovery. The therapist might also choose
to be open and express immediate feelings and reactions to what the client says.


Supportive counselling


The primary purpose of supportive counselling is to provide the client with a relationship and environment
that allow the client to explore those issues of greatest concern. This is usually less structured than more
goal-oriented therapies and often is ongoing rather than time limited. The therapist will typically express
unconditional positive regard toward the client and will try to create an atmosphere of warmth and caring.


Assessment


Initial assessment of clients varies considerably in complexity. Some assessments are simple and aimed
at determining whether or not the client is an alcoholic or an addict. These assessments often involve going
over a checklist of alcohol or drug-related problems and making a yes/no determination on the basis of the
summary score. Other assessments are much more detailed and measure functioning in a variety of domains
such as quantity/frequency of consumption, antecedents to and consequences of use, problems and
dependence, family history, medical and neuropsychological sequelae and motivational state. These more
complex assessments may include physical examinations, laboratory work and psychometric testing in
addition to a clinical interview.


Goals: The primary goal of these strategies is to set the stage for change. This includes developing an
environment of trust and caring in which the client can discuss sensitive issues. Assessment, when properly


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 105


conducted, also produces this environment and has the added benefit of providing the therapist with
information helpful to design a plan of treatment.


Philosophy: The underlying philosophy is a psychological model that focuses on how the environment of
treatment affects a client's willingness to deal with issues of importance.


Efficacy: Assessment and empathic and reflective listening are key elements of brief interventions which
are well supported by controlled research. Brief interventions are discussed below. There is no evidence
for the efficacy of supportive counselling alone (Holder et al., 1991 ).


MOTIVATIONAL STRATEGIES


A wide array of approaches attempt to address the client's motivations to continue to drink or use drugs as
well as to stop. Those that are psychoanalytically or psychodynamically oriented are presented and
discussed here.


Confrontation


Different conceptualizations of denial have led to a number of disparate interventions to overcome it.
Programmes which consider an acceptance of the label "alcoholic" or "addict" as a vital first step may use
aggressive methods to confront the client. The therapist attempts to persuade the client that he or she "has
a problem" or is an alcoholic or addict by forcefully presenting evidence of the client's addiction and
substance abuse related problems. Any disagreement or doubt by the client is seen as further evidence that
the client is in denial and the therapist forcefully argues this. The purpose of this form of confrontation is
to destroy defences that prevent clients from admitting their disease.


Videotape self-confrontation


A form of confrontation which appears to have fallen into disuse is videotape self-confrontation. Here
clients are videotaped in an intoxicated state. Later, when they are sober, they are shown the videotape as
evidence of how they act when intoxicated.


"The intervention"


Another form of confrontation is sometimes called "the intervention" or "an intervention". Here the
therapist meets with family members of a potential client and sets up a surprise meeting of family members,
therapist and clients together. Prior to the meeting, the therapist uses role play to show family members
ways to tell the individual that his or her drinking or drug use has caused significant problems in their lives.
Family members are also shown how to state their desire to see the individual stop drinking or using drugs.
The therapist and family members work out the financial arrangements for treatment and the family may
pack a suitcase of clothes for the individual if the treatment is residential. The goal of "the intervention"
is to have the individual agree to treatment. If the client is unwilling to enter treatment immediately, the
therapist and family members try to get the client to agree both to stop drinking or using drugs and to enter
treatment if drinking or using drugs is resumed.

Brief interventions


Clinical researchers have recently reviewed psychological theories of motivation and have reconceptualized
the notion of denial. This has led to a different approach to overcoming denial. This new approach is
known as brief or minimal intervention and while still not widely used, it has been well supported in
controlled clinical trials. Common elements ofbrief(i.e. 1-3 sessions) interventions can be remembered
by the acronym FRAMES: objective Feedback of personal status following a comprehensive evaluation;
an emphasis on the client's personal Responsibility for change; Advice to change; a Menu of alternative
strategies for change; an Empathic counsellor style; and emphasis on Self-efficacy and optimism. Periodic
follow-up visits have also been included in most studies ofbriefinterventions.


Client-centred and other self-exploration approaches


A number of non-analytically based counselling approaches are used with clients. Among them is the
client-centred approach first described by Carl Rogers. In its purest form, the therapist does not impose
goals or directions on the client. Rather, through reflective listening, the therapist allows the client to
develop his or her own goals and the means to achieve them. Some counselling asks clients to define and
clarify their values and relate those values to their behaviours and goals. In these approaches, clients are
encouraged to take responsibility for their decisions and actions. More existentially-oriented therapists tend
to focus on issues of meaning. Spiritually-oriented or religious counsellors may focus on spiritual issues.
These approaches often use the empathic/reflective listening and self-disclosure described earlier, but here
the goals of these approaches extend beyond that of establishing a therapeutic relationship.


Motivational interviewing


Motivational interviewing is a relatively new approach for increasing clients' motivation for changing
drinking and drug use (Miller & Rollnick, 1991 ). It combines aspects of client-centred counselling with
the common elements of brief interventions. Although directive and evocative, in many ways it is the
opposite of the direct, aggressive and often hostile confrontational approaches to overcoming denial. The
therapist elicits the client's concerns and with reflective listening gradually helps the client shift his or her
own attitudes about drinking or drug use. Objective feedback from an assessment is presented in low-key
fashion rather than as proof that the client has a disease or is an addict.


Hypnosis


Hypnosis means many different things to different people. In practice what seems to separate hypnotherapy
from other approaches is its use of the trance state. The trance state has been broadly defined as attention
turned inward. This definition allows for tremendous variability in what different therapists call
hypnotherapy. Hypnosis has been used to help clients reconceptualize their addictions, to reduce urges and
cravings via post-hypnotic suggestion and to rehearse future events mentally. Many hypnotherapists teach
their clients self-hypnosis as a coping strategy to deal with stresses in their lives.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 107


Ericksonian psychotherapy


This form of therapy is similar to hypnosis except that therapists do not induce an obvious trance state.
Instead, they use metaphors or storytelling to reconceptualize problems and solutions. The therapist uses
stories to bring up and present issues that provoke too much anxiety in the client to be discussed directly.
An important goal of this technique is to reduce client resistance to change. In practice this form of
treatment seems to share common elements with motivational interviewing.


Narcoanalysis


Narcoanalysis is a procedure whereby the therapist, usually a trained psychiatric nurse, administers enough
intravenous sodium pentothal to the client to induce disinhibition but not enough to cause unconsciousness.
Once the client has achieved this hypnagogic state, the therapist will interview the client to ascertain his or
her thoughts about alcohol and drugs and current motivations either to continue or to stop drinking and
using drugs.


Goals: The main goal of these strategies is to increase the client's motivation to change. In this sense,
these strategies can also be thought of as attempts to modify the antecedents of alcohol or drug use.


Philosophy: The underlying philosophy is an implicit or explicit psychological model of motivation for
change. The more traditional approaches, such as confrontation and videotape self-confrontation, are based
on the notion that a client's defence mechanism of denial is a central component of the disease and must be
broken down before he or she can begin to recover. The newer approaches draw on theories of attitudinal
change in social psychology. These theories emphasize the importance of an individual's statements to
himself and others in changing attitudes.
Efficacy: The amount and quality of data on efficacy vary substantially across these approaches. Evidence
on more aggressive and directive confrontational approaches has not been favourable. MacDonough ( 197 6)
found little improvement when clients were treated with an intensive confrontational approach. Annis and
Chan found that clients with low self-esteem fared worse with a hostile and aggressive confrontational
approach than if they had not received this approach. Evidence from the general psychotherapy literature
indicates that hostile and aggressive leadership styles are associated with more negative outcomes than other
leadership styles (Lieberman, Yalom & Miles, 1973). The controlled studies of videotape selfconfrontation consistently found poor outcomes and this strategy appears to have fallen into disuse. There
have been no controlled trials of "the intervention". Likewise, there have been no controlled studies of the
efficacy of narcoanalysis. Controlled clinical trials of hypnosis have been indeterminate (Holder et al.,
1991). The picture is complicated by a great diversity of goals and techniques which have been called
"hypnosis". Brief interventions have generally received support from controlled clinical trials (Bien &
Miller, 1991; Heather, 1989).


STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE SELF-ESTEEM AND SELF-AWARENESS


Many treatment providers place importance on enhancing self-esteem and self-awareness. The following
are strategies designed with an emphasis on these aspects of recovery.


WHO/PSN93.10
page 108


Diary/journal writing


One way therapists increase the self-awareness of their clients is to have them keep a structured diary on
various aspects of themselves. In keeping a behavioural diary, clients may write down the day's positive
and negative events and how to handle them next time. This form of self-monitoring focuses attention on
the client's reactions to his or her environment A journal may also encompass broader themes of selfexploration.


Activity/recreation therapy


A variety of activities has been used by therapists to increase self-esteem. These include involving the
client in competitive and non-competitive sports, aerobic exercise, both on-site and off-site challenge
experiences, massage, art therapy, movement therapy and work/occupational therapy. Challenge
experiences may involve having the client perform difficult physical tasks such as climbing up sheer rock
faces or climbing down cliff faces by rope. All of this is done under close supervision with the goal of
pushing the client physically and psychologically to do things he or she never thought possible. Art
therapies have the client engage in developing creativity and self-expression. Movement therapies
encourage clients to become more aware of their bodies and more positive about them. Massage therapy
involves receiving massages and in some instances, learning how to give them. In work therapy clients are
given responsibilities and expected to perform them. The purpose here is often to instill discipline and
positive self-esteem through productivity.


Goals: The goal of these strategies is to modify self-esteem and self-awareness as deterrents to substance
abuse.


Philosophy: The underlying philosophy is a psychological model of personality which hypothesizes a
relationship between a person's sense of self-worth and substance use.


Efficacy: Little is known about the efficacy of either diary6ournal writing or activity/recreational therapies.
Evidence relating self-esteem to recovery is mixed.


STRATEGIES TO ALTER MALADAPTIVE COGNITIONS


Cognitive strategies emphasize changing the clients' perceptions and use of drugs as well as life situations
that both precede and follow from their use or sobriety. While many approaches also include strategies for
behavioural change, the primary focus tends to be on how the client thinks.


Cognitive therapies


In cognitive therapy, the focus is on how the client interprets the world around him or her. The emphasis
is on the client's thoughts which have also been described as self-statements or cognitions. The therapist
may ask the client to self-monitor his or her thoughts which precede or are associated with many different
feelings or events. This self-monitoring can take the form of writing thoughts down on cards or keeping
a tally of repetitive thoughts. With this information, the therapist and client look for antecedent events and
commonalities in the thoughts. If the therapist is concerned about a client's emotional state, such as


WHO/PSA/93.1 0

page 109


depression, the therapist may examine the thoughts to see if the client is distorting events in such a way as
to be predisposed to depression. The first step is identification of maladaptive or irrational thoughts. In
the second step, the therapist and client develop different self-statements to counteract and replace the
maladaptive thoughts. Cognitive therapists may also focus on the client's positive expectations about the
benefits of alcohol or drug use.


Thought stopping


Thought stopping is a technique of cognitive therapy whereby clients learn to interrupt and decrease the
frequency of repetitive and intrusive thoughts. The basic procedure is that as soon as the client is aware
of thinking the repetitive thoughts, he or she says "stop" aloud or covertly. This interrupts the ongoing flow
of the thoughts. The client then has the option of thinking of a scene he or she has prepared in advance.
The scene is peaceful and calm. The client thinks of this image briefly then returns to whatever he or she
was doing before using the thought stopping. The client practises this procedure every time he or she
experiences an intrusive or repetitive thought or craving.


Goals: The primary goal of cognitive therapies is to modify the cognitive antecedents of substance use.


Philosophy: The philosophy is a psychological model which emphasizes the importance of thoughts in
directing an individual's actions. Thoughts form the basis for behavioural actions as well as for emotional
states. Certain ways of thinking may predispose clients to negative emotional states which, in turn, may
precipitate a resumption of substance use.


Efficacy: There have been five controlled studies of the effectiveness of cognitive or cognitive-behavioural
treatments. The overall picture is mixed. Two studies found modest improvements in outcome relative to
other treatments (Brandsma, Maultsby & Welsh, 1980; Oei & Jackson, 1982) while three studies found
no significant differences in outcomes when cognitive therapies were compared to other interventions.
Holder and his colleagues (Holder et al., 1991) considered the overall evidence to be indeterminate.


STRATEGIES FOR PROVIDING NEW KNOWLEDGE


Education


Education about the effects of alcohol, drug abuse and addictions takes a variety of forms. A popular
format is to give group lectures or show fllms that describe the acute effects of alcohol and drugs as well
as the negative consequences of use and abuse. Typically clients are given descriptions of how heavy
alcohol and drug use affects the body, mind, personality and spirit. They may be shown examples of
individuals whose lives have been ruined by drinking or drug use. Clients also may be shown graphic
scenes of damage caused by people who are intoxicated (e.g. videos of fatal automobile accidents that are
alcohol related). In another form of education, therapists lecture clients or show them fllrns that describe
a particular model of addiction such as the American disease model.


WHO/PSA/93 .1 0
page 110


Blood alcohol concentration training


A less common form of education has been to help individuals learn to estimate their own blood alcohol
concentrations (BACs). This has been done in two ways. Originally therapists would give clients
controlled amounts of alcohol to drink, ask them to estimate their BACs, then give them a breath alcohol
test and immediate feedback about their actual BAC. Clients could learn to discriminate different BACs
by internal cues from this feedback process. Subsequently other therapists found that clients could learn
to estimate their BACs by self-monitoring the amount they drank and the time it took to drink a given
amount. Using those two numbers and a table which lists peak BACs, clients can learn to estimate their
peakBACs.


Bibliotherapy


Another form of education, now known as bibliotherapy, has developed in many English-speaking countries
and western Europe. In bibliotherapy, clients are given self-help materials that describe a series of concrete
steps the client can take i..1 sequence to change his or her behaviour. Bibliotherapy has been used as a form
of treatment with minimal therapist involvement. It has also been used in conjunction with a therapist
seeing clients individually and in groups to work through the material presented in the book.


Goals: The goal of education is to modicy knowledge as an antecedent to substance use.


Philosophy: The underlying philosophy is educational in nature. It emphasizes the importance of
providing clients with information they can use to make appropriate decisions about present and future
alcohol and drug use.


Efficacy: Controlled research has consistently not supported the use of general educational lectures and
films (Miller & Hester, 1986). Controlled studies have supported treatments which have included BAC
training (e.g. self-control training) but there is no evidence for the efficacy of BAC training by itself.
Controlled studies of bibliotherapy suggest that it is as effective a form of treatment, in some instances, as
therapist-administered treatment.


PSYCHOLOGICAL MODALITIES: BEHAVIOURAL STRATEGIES FOR ALTERING
SOCIAL CONTINGENCIES


Described here are several different strategies that primarily focus on altering the consequences both for
sobriety and for substance use or abuse.


Behaviour contracting


A number of interventions focus on changing the consequences of a client's behaviours. In behaviour
contracting, a therapist negotiates a contract with the client by which they agree that the client will receive
certain positive rewards if he or she is compliant with the therapist's directions or if certain goals, such as
a period of abstinence, are achieved. Typically the rewards chosen are negotiated between the therapist and
client but sometimes they are determined by programme policy. An example of the former is when a client
agrees to take his wife out to a special dinner if he has been abstinent or successful in moderating his


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 111


drinking during the previous week. An example of programme policy altering contingencies is when a
methadone programme offers a heroin client travel doses or take-home weekend doses if the client has
demonstrated a consistent pattern of urine samples free of opiates or other drugs.


Another form of behaviour contracting done in residential settings is called a token economy. In a token
economy, the programme develops a list of specific target behaviours it wishes to have clients do more
frequently. The client is reinforced for these behaviours with tokens. The tokens, in turn, can be exchanged
for other rewards such as tickets to the movies or being allowed to go on special outings. Different rewards
require different amounts of tokens.


External contingencies


Other interventions have focused on developing external contingencies that either reinforce sobriety or
punish drinking or drug use. Biomedical monitoring of drug use via urine screens has become a common
intervention, at least in the USA. Individuals in businesses and government who have been identified as
drug users may be subjected to random urine screens. If a screening test is positive for the presence of
drugs, the individual may lose his or her job or be subject to imprisonment if on parole from prison. Case
studies have also described treatments which involved community organizations and government
institutions. A therapist might, with the consent of the client, contact social service agencies and ask them
not to provide the client with services if the client is intoxicated at the time he or she requests them. In
addition to contingencies from employers, the legal system and social service agencies, some treatments
bring family and community pressure to bear on the client. A programme might, for instance, ask a family
to agree to let a client remain in jail if arrested for drunken driving or public intoxication. External
contingencies with a positive focus have also been used. Therapists may ask families to support abstinent
clients in their efforts to return to work, reintegrate into the community, and so on. Sobriety may be
reinforced by providing the client with services, treatments or rewards the client wishes to receive.


Marital/family therapy


Variations of family and marital therapy exist and have different theoretical bases but a common goal,
redefining how the client and other family members interact to reinforce the client's sobriety. Behavioural
marital and family therapy teaches a client and other family members specific communication and problemsolving skills. The emphasis in structural family therapy is on the family as a functional unit that consists
of a collection of interrelated individuals and subsystems. Once substance abuse has developed in a family
unit, a homeostasis may develop which can maintain the abuse and resist change. The purpose of structural
family therapy is to help family members change the rules that maintain the homeostasis. This in turn
results in a restructuring of the roles in the family. In both cases the husband and wife are typically seen
together. One variation of structural family therapy that has been used with adolescent drug abusers is
called unilateral family therapy. In this form of treatment, the therapist works with the client alone to bring
about a crisis in the family. When the crisis is reached, the therapist sees the entire family and works to
make changes in the roles of the different family members. Once this is accomplished, the therapist may
return to seeing the client on an individual basis. Behavioural therapists may also work with an individual
to bring about changes in how family members communicate with each other and solve problems.
Goals: The most common goal of altering social contingencies is to modify the consequences of substance
use. Clients are typically rewarded for remaining sober and sometimes punished for substance use. Marital


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 112


or family therapy and behavioural contracting may focus on both the antecedents to use and the
consequences of use.


Philosophy: The underlying philosophy for most of these interventions is a psychosocial model which
emphasizes the relationship between behaviours and reinforcers. For structural marital and family therapy,
however, the philosophy is still psychosocial but focuses more on interpersonal dynamics.


Efficacy: Overall, the effectiveness of altering social contingencies seems well supported by controlled
research. Randornized clinical trials have found that adding behavioural marital therapy to a programme
improved the outcomes (O'Farrell & Cowles, 1989). Holder and his colleagues (1991) concluded that the
level of evidence is good for behavioural marital therapy. Case studies of behaviour contracting have also
found that the client's drinking behaviours were substantially reduced during the period of a behavioural
contract (Miller, 1975). Experimental support for the efficacy of a family systems approach is currently
lacking.


STRATEGIES TO MANAGE USE


Included here are interventions which focus directly on changing the client's alcohol/drug use and which
teach methods to deal with internal and external cues to use. These interventions are self-control training,
drink/drug refusal, drug-free leisure time activities and giving advice.


Self-control training


Self-control training consists of a sequence of self-change skills that clients learn either from a therapist
or from a self-help manual. The training can be used to pursue a goal of either moderation or abstinence.
It commonly consists of the following techniques: self-monitoring of use or urges, setting limits on
consumption, controlling the rate of consumption (e.g. sipping versus gulping), developing rewards for
achieving goals and punishments for missing goals, and analysing situations that put the client at risk of
relapse.


Drink/drug refusal


In this training clients are taught specific assertiveness skills to refuse the social pressures of others to drink
or use drugs. First the therapist describes the various components of assertiveness - including eye contact,
body language, tone and volume of voice - in addition to the verbal content of appropriate assertiveness
statements. He or she then models these behaviours in role play. The client takes the role of a friend trying
to persuade the therapist to drink or use drugs and the therapist responds assertively. It is then the client's
turn to describe situations where he or she is likely to encounter social pressures. Using these situations
as a basis, the therapist takes the role of the client's friend and tries to persuade the client to accept a drink
or use drugs. After the role play, the therapist gives the client constructive feedback about what he or she
did well and what needs improvement. Following this the therapist and client engage in further role play
sessions until the therapist determines that the client is proficient in assertively refusing social pressures
to drink or use drugs.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 113


Drug-free leisure time activities


Since many clients have spent much of their leisure time drinking or using drugs, they may not know what
to do once they stop drinking or using drugs. One form of counselling aims to help the client rediscover
or explore leisure time activities. This ranges from suggesting activities that are incompatible with heavy
drinking or drug use to taking clients out on excursions to sample different activities. This form of
counselling is not to be confused with treabnents such as challenge experiences described earlier, where the
purpose is to build confidence and self-esteem. The purpose here is to help the client fill his or her leisure
time in pleasurable ways that are also inconsistent with drinking or drug use.


Giving advice


Although advice is not usually thought of as a specific treatment, therapists frequently give various kinds
of advice in treatment for alcohol and drug problems. Giving advice varies somewhat from other treatments
in this section in that the therapist will usually tell clients what to do rather than show them how to do it.
The most frequent forms of advice seem to focus on the following: abstaining completely from alcohol and
drugs; attending Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, other 12-step groups and less frequently
other, less traditional groups (e.g. Rational Recovery, Women for Sobriety, Drinkwatchers, Secular
Organizations for Sobriety); getting a sponsor to assist in recovery efforts; and coping with urges to
drink/use and relapses.


Goals: The goal of self-control training and drink/drug refusal is to modify the consumption of alcohol and
other drugs directly. Giving advice spans the spectrum of goals. The primary goal of drug-free leisure time
activities is to modify the antecedents of substance use.


Philosophy: The philosophy behind most of these interventions is a psychological model which assumes
that clients either do not know how to change their behaviours or do not know how to deal with pressures
or urges to drink or use drugs.


Efficacy: Self-control training has been extensively tested in randomized clinical trials. Its efficacy has
been well supported (Hester & Miller, 1989b; Holder et al., 1991). Social skills training is discussed below.
It is well supported by controlled research and typically includes training in drink/drug refusal skills. It is
difficult to estimate the impact of giving advice independent of the context in which it is given. For
instance, giving advice is a part of brief interventions which are supported by controlled research and
discussed above. It is also a part of traditional confrontational approaches which are not supported by
controlled research. Controlled trials of drug-free leisure time activities have not been conducted.


STRATEGIES TO TEACH GENERAL COPING SKILLS


In addition to teaching clients ways to change their drinking, a number of interventions train general coping
skills. Included in this class are relaxation training, stress management, social skills, problem solving skills,
job-fmding and specific job (i.e. vocational rehabilitation) skills.


WHO/PSN93.10
page 114


Biofeedback


Biofeedback is a process in which clients learn how to control various aspects of their physiological
functioning. In treatment they are usually attached to a device which monitors and gives immediate
feedback about a specific physiological function. Through this monitoring and feedback process, clients
learn how to discriminate between various levels of functioning and how to increase and decrease them.
The assumption here is that clients will learn how to better control various aspects of their physiological
functions that are associated with arousal and anxiety. The most common forms of biofeedback have been
muscular and peripheral body temperature, monitored by electromyograph (EMG) and thermal
measurement devices respectively. A less common form of biofeedback today is measurement of brain
waves with an electroencephalograph (EEG). The purpose of EEG biofeedback is to help the client learn
how to produce more alpha brain waves because they are associated with states of relaxation. Its use has
declined, however, since researchers found few differences in the physiological state of relaxation produced
by EEG and EMG biofeedback and the latter is much cheaper to administer. Another form of biofeedback
is blood alcohol concentration discrimination training which was described earlier.


Relaxation training


There are numerous ways to teach clients relaxation skills. While no one technique stands out as superior
in its effectiveness, there do seem to be large differences in the acceptability of the techniques to different
people. In addition to biofeedback there is progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, yoga and
transcendental meditation. In progressive muscle relaxation the client voluntarily tenses and relaxes groups
of muscles. The therapist asks the client to focus his or her attention on the sensations of the muscle as it
releases tension. The client also is directed to breathe slowly and deeply throughout the tensing and
relaxing. Therapists will often make audio tapes of this training and ask the client to practise at home daily.


The goal of relaxation is the same in autogenic training but the process is different. Here the client repeats
a series of phrases while breathing deeply slowly. An example is, "My hands are getting warm and heavy
... I am becoming more and more relaxed". In yoga, the client is taken through a series of physical stretches
while at the same time focusing on slow deep breathing. In transcendental meditation the client is given
a word, called a "mantra", to repeat over and over again while practising slow deep breathing and emptying
the mind of thoughts.


Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy (REST)


Some evidence exists to suggest that alcoholics tend to have excessively fast EEG brain activity. REST
is a technique developed to reduce excessively fast EEG activity. From a content standpoint, REST seems
to constitute a variation of relaxation training. In REST the client lies comfortably on a bed for 90 minutes
in a dark silent room that is air-conditioned and sound-proofed. At the 90-minute mark, the client listens
to a taped anti-alcohol message. The client then continues to rest in the room for another hour before being
removed.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 115


Stress management


Because many clients have histories of drinking heavily or using drugs in response to stressful situations,
stress management training seems to be gaining in popularity. This training involves teaching a variety of
skills depending on the client's particular situation. It may involve training in relaxation skills, training the
client to use different self-statements or cognitions to reconceptualize the stressful situation, or
assertiveness skills. For instance, rather than say to themselves, "This job is too big, I'll never get it done
in time", clients might be encouraged to tell themselves, "Relax, take a slow deep breath. Now, take this
one step at a time. What do I have to do next?" Alternative stress management procedures have included
systematic sensitization.


Social skills


Broadly defined, social skills training involves teaching clients how to interact with others to get their needs
met and to resolve conflicts. The two general categories of social skills training are assertiveness and
communication skills. In the former, therapists defme both the verbal and non-verbal aspects of
assertiveness and then use role play to practise assertive behaviours with the client. The procedure is the
same as that for alcohoVdrug refusal training. The difference here is that clients learn how to be assertive
in a broad range of situations. In communication skills training therapists teach clients how to listen and
talk to other people. This can range from learning how to initiate conversations with strangers to dealing
with conflicts with a spouse. Typically the therapist will describe how it is done and then behaviourally
rehearse a scene with the client The client may learn how to ask open-ended questions, how to listen to
what another person says and how to verify that he or she understood what that other person said. The
therapist may teach the client how to make empathic statements. After each behavioural rehearsal the
therapist gives the client constructive feedback. Training ideally continues until the client can be assertive
or communicate more effectively in a wide variety of situations.


Problem solving


Training in problem solving typically consists of four steps. The frrst is to define the problem and here the
client specifies the problem situation as well as the goals he or she wishes to achieve. The second step
involves generating alternatives. In this step the client brainstorms possible solutions. Evaluation or
criticism of an alternative is discouraged in this step. Thirdly, there comes decision making. Here the
client evaluates each choice. The likely consequences and the value of each possibility are considered. Only
then does the client decide upon a course of action. The fourth step is to do evaluating. As the client takes
the course of action he or she evaluates the results. If the course of action is successful, the client keeps
doing it or may expand on it. If the client is not as successful as he or she wishes, a re-evaluation of the
problem or the choices of action may be appropriate.


Job-finding skills


Knowing how to find a job involves skills different than the job skills themselves. While many people may
have adequate job skills, some do not know the most appropriate ways to go about getting a job. Jobfinding skills training teaches those skills. Elements of this training include: developing a resume;
instruction and practice in filling out job applications; using a variety of sources to generate job leads (e.g.


WHO/PSA/93 .1 0
page 116


friends, relatives, and the telephone book); behavioural rehearsal in telephone techniques to secure
interviews and in interviewing; and information on what is appropriate employment in view of a client's
background and experience.


Job skills


The complement to job-fmding skills is training in actual job skills. This is sometimes referred to as
vocational rehabilitation. If clients have few job skills they can improve their chances of getting work if
they receive additional training either in basic education (e.g. reading, writing) or in applied job skills (e.g.
typing, carpentry, business management). When this type of training is provided it is usually, though not
always, provided by a specialized vocational training programme rather than by a specialized treatment
programme.


Goals: The primary goal of strategies to teach general coping skills is to modify the antecedents to
substance use.
Philosophy: The philosophy underlying these strategies is a belief that teaching clients how to deal better
with life stressors (e.g. unemployment) that predispose them to drinking or drug use, will lessen the
likelihood that they will use alcohol or drugs to deal with those stressors.


Efficacy: Relaxation training by itself is not well supported by controlled research. There is, at best,
modest evidence of its efficacy in controlled studies (e.g., Freedberg & Johnston, 1978) and the overall
picture would indicate that it has little impact on drinking related outcomes. One possible reason for these
findings may be indicated in the results of a study by SD Rosenberg (Rosenberg, 1979). He found an
improvement on drinking measures at follow-up for clients who had received relaxation training, but only
if they had high levels of anxiety.


Controlled research provides evidence supportive of social skills training (Chaney, O'Leary & Marlatt,
1978; Holder et al., 1991). There is also good evidence of effectiveness for stress management training
(Holder et al., 1991). To our knowledge, training in problem solving, job fmding or job skills have been
evaluated only as components of more comprehensive programmes and their specific impact has not been
parcelled out.


STRATEGIES TO COUNTER-CONDITION AND EXTINGUISH CRA VINGS AND
URGES TO DRINK OR USE DRUGS


A number of treatments have been developed to reduce or eliminate clients' conditioned responses to cues
or stimuli associated with drinking and drug use. If an abstinent client experiences urges or cravings when
exposed to these cues, this may pose a threat to the client's sobriety. Several approaches are aimed at
breaking the relationship between cues and craving. These include aversion therapies, fading procedures
and cue exposure.


Aversion therapy


There are three general classes of aversion therapy: chemical, electrical and imaginal or covert sensitization.
In both chemical aversion and covert sensitization the procedure is similar but the agent is different. We


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 117


will describe the procedure for chemical aversion to illustrate the process. In chemical aversion therapy the
client is exposed to the sight, smell, and taste of alcohol after he or she has received a dose of emetine but
before experiencing nausea. Once the client becomes nauseous he or she continues to see, smell, and taste
alcohol. Through repeated pairings of alcohol and nausea, the client develops an aversion to the alcohol
and may become sick at the sight or taste of it even in the absence of emetine. The procedure is similar
whether the chemical substance produces nausea either systemically as with emetine or externally as with
odours that the client smells and becomes nauseous. (A variation of this aversion therapy has been to
produce apnea, usually through the administration of succinylcholine, and then pass alcohol over the lips
and nose of the client. This procedure was used in the 1960s but appears to have been abandoned.) In
covert sensitization the therapist typically presents images to provoke nausea. While covert sensitization
can be done on an outpatient basis, chemical aversion has generally been done on an inpatient basis under
medical supervision. In electrical aversion the procedure is somewhat different. Here the unconditioned
stimulus is an electric shock, usually administered to the client's hand or forearm.


Fading


Fading is a procedure in which the client gradually consumes smaller and smaller quantities of alcohol or
drugs. This is done by switching to lower doses gradually and has most often been used in cessation of
smoking.


Cue exposure


Cue exposure is a relatively new form of counter-conditioning. Cues are presented either in vivo or in the
client's imagination. Clients first develop a hierarchy of cues which range from the least to the most
powerful in their ability to elicit cravings. The client is taught relaxation exercises and is asked to practise
them to achieve a state of deep relaxation. Following this, the client is gradually exposed to the cues and
rituals in the hierarchy. If the client signals that he or she is starting to become aroused or tense, the
therapist backs up a step in the hierarchical list of cues until the client is calm once more. The therapist
moves ahead and presents the next cue in the list while the client tries to remain calm. Gradually, over
repeated sessions, the client is able to remain relaxed and calm in the presence of cues which in the past had
resulted in arousal and the experience of cravings.


Goals: The goal of counter-conditioning treatments is to modify both the antecedents to and consequences
of use.


Philosophy: The philosophy is a psychological model with an emphasis on classical conditioning and taste
aversion.


Efficacy: Uncontrolled clinical outcome studies of chemical aversion have been published by one hospital
group in the western USA for 50 years. Abstinence rates at one year are typically around 60% in these
reports. Controlled comparisons, however, present a much more mixed picture. A recent comparative study
by the same hospital group found a significantly better outcome for aversion therapy compared to treatment
with more common treatments in the USA (Smith & Frawley, 1991). Trials with treatment populations
other than of this hospital group, however, have not found significant differences in outcome relative to


WHO/PSN93.10
page 118


control groups receiving other forms of treatment. The results of controlled comparisons for electrical
aversion is also mixed, while the evidence for covert sensitization is fair (Holder et al., 1991).


PSYCHOLOGICAL MODALITIES: PSYCHODYNAMIC


Psychodynamic therapies are based on a variety of theories about the structure of the mind and its
development. Freud is generally credited with formulating the view that behaviour is the outcome of an
interplay of unconscious and conscious motives. It is hypothesized that many conflicts arise from the need

to accommodate primitive desires within the demands of sociocultural expectations concerning acceptable
behaviour. Various psychological defence mechanisms operate in a predominantly unconscious attempt
to resolve wishes and constraints that are regarded as incompatible. Many of these conflicts are believed
to have had their origin in childhood.


During the past 50 years a bewildering range of schools of psychodynamic therapy have developed. Most
therapies have been tried in the management of substance abuse. In most circumstances the underlying
conflicts rather than the drinking or drug taking as such, are taken as the primary target for therapy.
Psychodynamic therapies have commonly been employed alongside other therapies more specifically
focused on substance abuse. The process of psychotherapy is often stressful for the client and there is some
doubt of its value except in selected cases. There have been few evaluation studies of these approaches and
their efficacy remains not proven (Miller and Rester, 1986; Saunders, 1989; Holder et al., 1991).


STRATEGIES OF PSYCHODYNAMIC THERAPY


Many varied strategies have been developed to relieve the psychodynamic conflicts, neuroses and
interpersonal difficulties that are often associated with substance abuse. Psychoanalysis is a technique for
accessing the unconscious mind by a process of free association in which the client voices thoughts as they
come into the mind without conscious editing. This therapy is often very prolonged. Recently there has
been a trend toward briefer and more focused psychodynamic psychotherapies. These can be conducted
on an individual or group basis. Some of these approaches, such as transactional analysis, have been
regularly used with substance abusers.


Experiential therapies are founded on a belief that understanding underlying conflicts is less important than
a capacity to experience and acknowledge feelings that are released in the trusting relationship with a
therapist. Carl Rogers ( 1969) was a major proponent of this philosophy and his non-directive approach
has developed into a range of encounter and experiential groups that have often been part of the therapeutic
community movement. Elements of this approach are to be found in the "Concept" houses such as
Synanon. These therapists share a common belief in the process of self-actualization attained by means of
enhanced self-awareness and freedom of expression. This form of psychotherapy is more concerned with
self-fulfilment than with unravelling conflicts. These therapies are exemplified by the emphasis on
a holistic approach toward individuals and their psychological problems seen in Gestalt therapies. They
are closely allied to spiritual or conversion experiences toward a way of life that excludes substance abuse.


Settings


Psychodynamic and experiential therapies may be employed in any setting. They can be part of an
inpatient, day patient or other residential programme. On their own they are most often experienced on a
regular consultation or out patient basis.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 119


Administrative auspices


Psychodynamic therapies may be integrated into health or social services, though many of these approaches
are offered by independent trained counsellors or psychotherapists working either as part of a group or in
an individual private practice.


Target drugs


All forms of substance abuse may be targeted by these approaches. Clients' personality attributes,
intrapsychic or interpersonal conflicts and concomitant psychopathology are usually taken as more critical
determinants of therapy than the substance used or the degree of dependence. Many therapists would,
however, expect the patient to be drug-free or at least recovered from withdrawal symptoms prior to
therapy.


Interactive unit


Most forms of psychotherapy have been offered on an individual or group basis. The underlying
psychodynamic concepts have also been applied to family and marital therapy.


Providers


The training requirements of psychotherapists and counsellors are very varied and standardization and
accreditation of therapists is a major problem in many countries. For some a personal analysis is a
prerequisite of training and this may take several years. For others training is much less rigorous. Many
professionals will have obtained an element of psychotherapeutic training and will use psychodynamic
concepts as part of their approach to understanding their clients. The cognitive strategies for establishing
a therapeutic relationship owe much to the tenets of psychodynamic therapy.


Time frame


At one extreme, therapy may be four or five hourly sessions per week over a period of years, but in most
cases the frequency is once or twice weekly and the duration between three and 12 months. Some
experiential groups are intensive, extending over many hours or even days but with low frequency.


Cost


The cost of these therapies varies from moderate to high (Holder et al., 1991) although an element of
psychodynamic therapy may be obtained at low cost to the client when it is part of professional training that
is then offered free at the point of delivery of care. It should be noted that the training costs themselves are
often high and an element of these opportunity costs need to be taken into account in assessing the total cost
to the health service.


Availability


In many countries there is virtually no therapy of this specific form available and in all but the most affluent
and developed it is in vety limited supply. However, similar therapies may be more available in different
forms (see, for instance, the chapter on mutual help groups). An element of psychodynamic therapy is
present in many psychological approaches and a pure form of psychological treatment is possibly less
common than is often supposed.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 120


The level of utilization is hard to assess. There has been increased demand for counselling in affluent
industrialized countries. In many countries it is restricted to the minority who have the means to pay. Some
individuals with problems or substance abuse utilise these counselling agencies and receive help without
being labelled as problem drinkers or drug takers. Their numbers are unknown. Where the agency
approached has a specific responsibility for substance abusers the likelihood of a client receiving
psychodynamic therapy is mostly dictated by the prevalence of staff trained in this approach.


Philosophy: Substance abuse is viewed as a maladaptive way of dealing with unresolved intrapsychic and
interpersonal conflicts. From this standpoint psychotherapy aims to improve the client's understanding of
these conflicts and, within the context of the relationship with the therapist (transference), attain a more
balanced self (Wolberg, 1977). It is assumed that this change will be associated with a reduction in or
cessation of substance abuse.


Efficacy: It is difficult to tease out the contribution that a psychodynamic approach has made to the
therapies with which it is often combined. There is no conclusive evidence of efficacy based on careful
controlled evaluations (Miller and Rester, 1986; Saunders, 1989). Nonetheless, individual reports of
benefits suggest that psychodynamic approaches may be most relevant when substance abuse coexists with
neuroses or personality disturbances that may be amenable to these techniques. This underlines the benefits
of careful matching of clients with therapies.


Therapists' own characteristics may also play a very important and little explored part in predicting
outcome.


GROUP TREATMENT


Therapy in groups is one of the units of treatment summarized in the table 1 (at the end of this section).
Group treatments have such a long-established place in the management of alcohol and drug related
problems that they merit additional consideration. It is possible that the model of Alcoholics Anonymous
(originating in 1935), whose sessions are conducted in groups, has been very important in influencing the
widespread popularity of the group approach. Groups also have the advantage of economy by allowing a
number of clients to participate in treatment simultaneously. In addition, groups have the merit of
facilitating identification with other sufferers who have similar problems and thus overcoming feelings of
isolation. Mutual understanding facilitates support and fellowship but it also ensures that denials and
evasions, which are prominent defences amongst substance abusers, can be recognized and dealt with.


Many psychological treatments of the kind described above can be offered in groups (see format column
in the table at the end of the chapter). These include cognitive behavioural approaches, of which Oei and
Jackson (1982) demonstrated the benefit for alcoholic patients in a randomized controlled trial. Other
examples are social skills acquisition groups, educational groups about the effects and dangers of substance
abuse, assertiveness training, fellowship and mutual help support groups - as evidenced, for example, by
Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Vie Libre or groups based on families or on a particular
workplace (a pattern that is common in Eastern Europe). Other activities such as role play, psychodrama,
music and dance therapy take place in groups. Many therapies concerned with spiritual. change or
conversion are also group activities that are believed to have therapeutic effects.


In many parts of the world, groups are based on the principle of mutual help. Their strength lies in bringing
together individuals with common problems and a single goal through fellowship, identification and mutual
understanding. These groups have become commonplace for alcohol problems, tranquillizer misuse and
other forms of drug dependence. Relatives of clients have also been brought together in groups for mutual


WHO/PSA/93.1 0

page 121


support and self-help. (Al-Anon and groups for the families of drug abusers are examples). Groups often
seem more effective if patients are interviewed and prepared in advance so that participants can anticipate
some of the issues and experiences likely to arise in the group process.


The range of procedures described above may make use of group processes but they are not commonly
thought of as group therapy. In group therapy the dynamic processes of the group itself are deemed
therapeutic. Such groups are commonly conducted by a trained group psychotherapist often accompanied
by an observer. In most circumstances the group will be closed so that the same individuals return on a
regular (usually weekly) basis over a considerable period of time. Each session lasts 60-90 minutes and
there is no fixed agenda. Closed groups usually have 8-12 participants whereas open groups are somewhat
larger and the membership more fluid. Groups within therapeutic communities may have as many as 30-50
members.


Group therapy has a number of advantages for substance abusers. ·The groups provide clients with an
opportunity to learn from each other, reducing the sense of personal stigma and uniqueness by sharing
experiences with others similarly affected. This often provides an environment of support and
encouragement within which changes can be made over time.


Certain key therapeutic mechanisms have been identified in the group process. These include interpersonal
learning, opportunities for identification, catharsis and the development of social skills. Groups also are
valuable in instilling hope, encouraging information sharing and providing role models (Brown and Y allom,
1977). The group normally has a leader who acts as facilitator encouraging therapeutic processes and
discouraging denial, evasions and other psychological defences.


Group psychotherapy can provide a corrective to the distorted interpersonal relationships of early life that
may influence adult behaviour. Within the group, participants may also experiment with new ways of
expressing themselves or handling old conflicts with support and encouragement from group members. In
such circumstances members may find, for example, that expressing anger does not bring the feared
rejection or that it is possible to be positive and friendly toward another person without being exploited.
Such experiences may later be transferred to actions in everyday life outside the group.


Some groups focus on particular categories of client, such as younger drug or alcohol abusers, women,
drunk driving offenders, the homeless or ethnic minorities.


Therapeutic communities are another variety of group treatment in which alcohol or drug abusers live
together in a community where there is regular scrutiny of members' behaviour and feelings. Most of these
groups are concerned with the here and now of current observable behaviour. Synanon is one well-known
example of this approach. This form of residential treatment is frequently protracted, lasting a year or more
(Rosental, 1989).


Group treatments may be part of an integrated package of therapies which combine individual therapies
with groups of various kinds. Many residential treatments are organized on this basis. In some, the mix
of therapies is a relatively inflexible package while in others there is a choice of therapies from which client
and therapist select an optional mix tailored to the client's needs.


**Philosophy:** Group therapy, in common with other psychodynamic approaches, assumes that substance
abuse is a symptom of underlying intrapsychic or interpersonal difficulties which need to be addressed if
a lasting cure is to be attained (Flores, 1988).


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 122


Efficacy: Despite widespread popularity, group therapy in substance abuse has not been shown to be more
effective than other treatment methods. It seems likely that certain individuals benefit from group
techniques but scientific information on how to select clients who are likely to benefit most is still lacking.

VI. HARM MINIMIZATION


Until recently there has been little to challenge the modern approach to drug policies in which a "war" is
being waged against illicit drugs. The focus has been on the substance with minimal attention paid to the
well-being of the drug user and his or her family and community. Factors that significantly influence
international drug policies often have little to do with health or social issues. It is now recognized that it
is no longer acceptable to ignore the impact that drug policies have on the health and well-being of our
communities. After decades of highly restrictive drug policies, it is evident that the international drug
problem is still growing, to the greater harm of our communities. In response to this, drug policies are being
questioned, and now there is a call for a more balanced approach between the control of substances and the
prevention of the harm associated with their use.


WHAT IS MEANT BY HARM MINIMIZATION?


Harm minimization is a term that is often used interchangeably with the term harm reduction. It is a term
which has recently received considerable prominence within discussions related to alcohol and other drug
issues. Owing to a lack of clear definition, and because of its association with a range of controversial
alcohol and other drug intervention strategies, the term has been largely misunderstood. Although most of
the concepts and strategies which are referred to under the harm minimization umbrella are not new, it is
their specific grouping together which provides an opportunity to adopt a different perspective when
addressing drug issues. To avoid further confusion in relation to this potentially useful term, a clear and
universally acceptable definition is necessary.


Figure 1 provides a graphical description of the discussion which follows, illustrating the subtle differences
in the ways in which harm minimization has been defmed. Currently, the terms "harm minimization" and
"harm reduction" are often used in two different ways - inclusive and exclusive.

Harm minimization as an overall aim or objective- inclusive


Firstly, the term is used to describe overall or general aims or objectives of alcohol and other drug policies
and interventions. Thus it provides an alternative to the traditional "drug-free" goal. In this context, the
problem is defined as any risk or harm associated with alcohol or other drug use. Harm may be defmed in
terms of the type of harm experienced (including health, psychosocial, vocational and economic problems)
and in terms of the level of harm experienced (to an individual, family, wider community or society)
(Newcombe, 1991). Risk relates to the probability of a possible outcome occurring. The primaryaim of
any intervention, therefore, is to reduce the associated harm. This contrasts with most mainstream
approaches in which drug use _per se_ is considered to be the problem, and where the primary aim is to
eradicate illicit drug use on the one hand and to reduce alcohol and other licit psychoactive substance use
on the other. In general, it is expected that a reduction in alcohol and other drug use will result in a
reduction in drug related harm.


To further illustrate this, intervention strategies that aim to reduce both harm and the level of alcohol and
other drug use are represented by _AB_ in Figure 1. These type _AB_ strategies constitute by far the largest
group of alcohol and other drug intervention strategies currently utilized. Other strategies, while aiming
to reduce harm, may at the same time actually result in an increase in overall drug use, as in some cases of
the sanctioned use of methadone for individuals with an opioid dependence. These are represented by type
_B_ strategies in Figure 1.


Many countries adopt an overall drug policy aim of reducing drug use (the so-called "drug-free" or
"abstinence" philosophies). Other countries argue that, in reality, the eradication of drug use is not possible.
They recognize that certain strategies which aim to reduce the level of drug use may actually contribute to
drug-related harm, here seen as type _A_ strategies in Figure 1. For example, the decreased availability of
certain drugs through criminalization may result in the adoption of more hazardous routes and patterns of
drug administration. Of note is the rapid change from opium smoking to opium and heroin injecting in
opium-producing areas of Asia as drug control measures have escalated and traditional cultures have been
eroded by economic development. The situation in relation to alcohol is somewhat different. Most
countries tolerate certain levels and patterns of alcohol use (Moser, 1980). Current government strategies,
therefore, range from prohibition (Mohan, 1991 ), through a reduction in per capita consumption of alcohol
(WHO, 1991) to the promotion of "sensible drinking" (Ministerial Group on Alcohol Misuse, 1991).
Some countries which endorse the philosophy of harm reduction have specifically adopted the reduction of
alcohol and other drug-related harm as their national campaign goal (Australian Department of Health,
1992; Health and Welfare Canada, 1992).


In this context, then, harm minimization may be referred to as an inclusive term that includes any strategy
which reduces actual harm or the risk of harm through alcohol or other drug use (that is, both _AB_ and _B_
strategies as represented in Figure 1). When conflict arises, strategies aimed at reducing harm take
precedence over efforts to reduce levels of drug use. As part of the National Campaign Against Drug
Abuse, the Australian Minister for Health, Neal Blewett (NCADA, 1987), stated:


"The National Campaign has as its aim 'to minimize the harmful effects of drugs on Australian
society'. Its ambition is thus moderate and circumscribed. No Utopian claims to eliminate drugs, or


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 133


drug abuse, or remove entirely the harmful effects of drugs, merely to minimize the effects of the
abuse of drugs on a society permeated by drugs."


There has been increasing support for a clear differentiation between the two terms "harm minimization"
and "harm reduction". In distinguishing between the two, harm minimization refers to the overall goal,
whereas harm reduction is an operational teen, referring to strategies which may be adopted to achieve such
a goal.


Harm minimization as a collection of specific strategies - exclusive


Secondly, "harm minimization" is widely used to refer to specific strategies designed to reduce alcohol or
other drug related harm without necessarily affecting the level or pattern of underlying drug use. "Harm
reduction strategies thus fall outside the dichotomy of supply reduction and demand reduction" (WHO,

1992). Within an international political environment where "zero tolerance" attitudes pervade, because they
do not address levels of drug use and because they tend to focus on illicit drug use, these strategies may be
viewed as controversial and often do not receive widespread support. Specific harm reduction strategies
as referred to in this context cover a wide spectrum, including:


strategies to reduce unsafe drug administration practices, such as needle-syringe exchanges,
education on cleaning of injecting equipment and targeted education on less risky practices of
inhaling solvents by children;
strategies which promote less hazardous routes of drug administration, such as promoting a
change from drug injecting to drug inhalation;
strategies which promote the use of less harmful drugs or drug preparations, such as methadone
maintenance and other drug substitution programmes;
strategies which aim to create a safer drug using environment, such as improving road
conditions, the training of drug users in the management of drug overdoses, the provision of
"fixing" rooms and educating users about the risks of using drugs alone;
strategies which aim to modify risky behaviour associated with drug use, such as welfare and
housing support to minimize the need to resort to criminal activity for survival, the provision of
condoms and information to reduce the risk of unsafe sexual practices, the installation of ignition
interlocks on cars to prevent drinking-driving, and drug screening in the workplace; and
strategies which reduce discriminatory and persecutory practices against drug users, thereby
reducing the marginalization of drug users and increasing accessibility to prevention and
treatment services, such as decriminalization of drug use and the establishment of drug user
advocacy groups.


The term "harm minimization" used within this context is thus exclusive. It excludes those strategies which
aim to reduce harm through a reduction in drug use (that is, it refers only to type _B_ strategies as represented
in Figure 1). Further to this, a distinction is not made between alcohol and other drugs, recognizing the
arbitrary nature in which the legal status of a drug is determined in history and across cultures.


This paper proposes that the first definition, in which the term is used as an overall aim or objective and
in which it is defined by inclusion rather than exclusion, has greater practical utility and therefore will be
used as the basis for further discussion. The second definition, in which there is a grouping together of a


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 134


range of controversial intervention strategies, risks marginalizing these strategies further and provides little
opportunity for determining the role of such strategies within a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach for
reducing drug-related harm. Such specific harm reduction strategies as needle-syringe exchange are unlikely
to succeed unless they are positioned within an overall strategy which includes complementary mainstream
interventions such as education and treatment. The further discussion in this paper does not make a
distinction between the two terms "harm reduction" and "harm minimization".


DEVELOPMENT OF THE HARM MINIMIZATION CONCEPT


It is useful to consider the history of the development of the harm minimization concept as an overall
objective as defmed above. In the early part of this century the response to alcohol and other drug problems
was dominated by the moral and disease models. With both models, owing either to moral weakness or to
an inherent vulnerability, certain individuals were viewed as having no control over their use of alcohol or
other drugs. The only cure for the problem was considered to be total abstinence. A prohibitionist and
abstinence mentality pervaded, focusing on the control of the substance, with the ultimate aim of eradicating
drug use. The development of such a mentality was the result of an extremely complex interplay of factors
in a rapidly changing society.


The emancipation of women contributed to the temperance movement (Sandmeier, 1980). The demands
of a new industrial society of the 20th century called for greater controls on social and economic life
(Levine, 1984). Population movements sparked overt racism, influencing the public perception of the use
of specific drugs, such as opium use among Chinese (Helmer, 1975), marijuana use by Mexicans (Musto,
1973) and cocaine use by Afroamericans (Ashley, 197 5). Although medical and other scientific arguments
relating to the harmful health and social consequences of alcohol and other drug use contributed to the
debate, they played only a secondary role to moral, political and economic arguments. This attitude was
further reinforced, for example, by periods of alcohol prohibition in the USA and powerful temperance
movements in other nations. Although this strategy proved to be a great political and social failure, with
mass disobedience and the creation of influential criminal networks, it paralleled the establishment of
prohibitionist policies for other drugs (Room, 1990).


In contrast, at the same time, a limited number of other countries chose to act upon the issue of alcohol and
other drug use within a public health framework Due to political and historical events, however, it was the
adoption of a prohibitionist approach and the use of law enforcement in the United States that helped to
determine the future international response to the problem. The strategic model adopted to achieve such
an abstinence goal was based on the market model of demand and supply, the commodity being the drug.
This model still dominates global drug policies today. Drug demand strategies include education, treatment
and rehabilitation. Supply reduction strategies range from crop destruction and substitution, interdiction
and scheduling of drugs, to controls in the production and marketing of licit substances such as alcohol.


Over time, it became apparent that many interventions targeting alcohol or other drug users did not neatly
fit within the supply reduction/demand reduction dichotomy. Increasing emphasis has been focused on the
harmful health and social consequences of alcohol and other drug use rather than upon drug use _per se._ The
shift in attitude also resulted from a recognition that both law enforcement and drug treatment approaches
had failed to achieve a drug-free society. This change in perspective has enabled this issue to be viewed


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 135


primarily as a health and social issue. Although a range of harm reduction strategies, such as the charitable
provision of shelter and food to severely damaged itinerant alcohol users, has been used for decades, most
of these programmes have also called for a reduction in, or cessation of, substance use. However, in certain
countries, not all harm reduction strategies have emphasized abstinence as the long-term goal. For example,
in the United Kingdom opioids, including heroin, have been made available to individuals with an opioid
dependence through limited medical prescribing. It was not until the early 1960s that abstinence-oriented
interventions were directly challenged through the introduction of methadone maintenance programmes in
the USA. Although many such programmes were introduced as an interim measure on the road to
abstinence, others argued in favour of a long-term maintenance role for methadone (Bellis, 1981; Newman,
1991).


There were signs in the 1970s that the principle of harm reduction, although not referred to in these
particular terms, was gaining greater support among clinicians working with individuals who were
experiencing problems related to their alcohol use but who were not prepared to stop drinking. It was
argued that, at least, such individuals should be encouraged to adopt less harmful patterns of alcohol use.
The further development of this philosophy witnessed the advent of the concept of controlled drinking
(Heather and Robertson, 1981).


At the same time, the debate broadened to include a wide range of professionals working in the field. In
1974, the 20th WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (WHO, 1974) stated in its report:


" .... the Committee is of the opinion that the _broad purpose of prevention_ in this field should be _to_
_prevent or reduce the incidence and severity of problems associated with the non-medical use of_
_dependence producing drugs._ This is a much broader goal than the prevention or reduction of drug use
_per se."_


Although controversial, it was not until this principle of harm minimization was more widely applied to
illicit drugs, such as heroin, that the associated ethical and philosophical issues became paramount in any
discussion of the issue. The appearance of HIV infection and AIDS acted as a catalyst to this discussion
and provided the necessary rationale for the targeting of illicit drug use within the framework of a harm
minimization philosophy (Wodak, 1991). This has in part required an acknowledgement that the prevention
ofHIV infection has a higher priority, in terms of health, than the prevention of illicit drug use. Although
the focus has been on HIV infection, the debate itself has enabled a broadening of the discussion to include
all aspects of harm associated with illicit drug use, ranging from hepatitis and septicaemia as a result of
asterile injecting practices through to criminal behaviour and social marginalization resulting from the illicit
nature of the drugs used. In contrast to its earlier use as a primary treatment for opioid dependence,
methadone is now widely promoted in various countries (predominantly developed countries) as a strategy
for reducing HIV infection and other harm associated with drug injecting and the use of illicit drugs.


STRATEGIES OF HARM MINIMIZATION


The concept of harm minimization recognizes that there is a continuum of levels and patterns of drug use
and a continuum of drug-related harm. It also recognizes that many, if not most, drug users do not
experience any significant problems related to their drug use. Likewise, there is a range of possible


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 136


intervention goals and strategies which may target non-users through to casual users and habitual users.
Therefore, it acknowledges that there is no single or limited set of strategies which can adequately address
the full range of potential drug related harms. The operationalization of this concept involves the use of
goal and strategy hierarchies where the goal is not limited exclusively to an abstinence outcome although
abstinence remains part of this hierarchy. The risks and harmful consequences of different patterns of drug
use are identified and priorities for action to reduce harm are determined.


The New South Wales Drug Strategy (NSW Department of Health, 1992) illustrates how this concept may
be incorporated within a comprehensive drug policy:


"A harm minimisation approach to these problems therefore necessarily involves a range of strategies
including demand reduction, supply control, controlled use, safer drug use, and abstinence."


It then goes on to state that:


"In practice this means a Drug Strategy based on a harm minimisation approach should have the
following primary objectives:


(i) To minimize the harm and the social problems to the individual and the community
resulting from the use of drugs;
(ii) to reduce the prevalence of hazardous levels and patterns of drug use in the community;
and,
(iii) to prevent the initiation into harmful or hazardous drug use, especially by young
people."


An essential element to this process is that of defining indicators of drug-related harm as opposed to
indicators of drug use. In defming such indicators, it is also important to recognize that the consequences
of drug use are not always viewed as being harmful. Some consequences of drug use may be viewed as
being neutral or even beneficial. For example, the religious use of hallucinogens by some indigenous
populations; the use of opium tonics by the elderly in Central Asia to treat pain; and the use of coca
products to ward off hunger and fatigue in the Andes. Therefore, indicators need to be able to reflect both
hannful and beneficial consequences. Such indicators are necessary for determining intervention goals and
for measuring the success of interventions, the goal being not only to reduce harm but also to optimize any
benefits. Often intermediate goals are set which are reviewed and renegotiated from time to time. The
content and structure of the different hierarchies will vary across communities and cultures and over time.
Intervention goals and strategies which are appropriate and feasible for one community may not be so for
another community (Shinfuku, 1992). Particular problems arise in cultures and communities where the drug
and its use, for moral or religious reasons, are considered to be greater evils than the actual physical harm
associated with the drug use. In the words ofO'Hare (1992), here laws exist as a statement of dominant
societal values rather than for the purpose of reducing drug-related harm. For example, methadone
maintenance therapy may not only be inappropriate for certain communities because of its cost and because
of the practical difficulties of dispensing and supervision, but also because methadone is itself a
psychoactive substance.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 137


It may be argued that the use of such goal and intervention hierarchies is too simplistic and quite artificial
when considering the actual implementation of effective strategies. Drug issues are extremely complex and
it has been recognized for a long time that there is no "magic bullet" when it comes to looking for solutions
to the many and varied problems encountered. Effective measures in the long term are always the complex
multifaceted ones which properly account for the cultural context in which they must operate. A goal of
harm minimization will only be effectively achieved where all strategies work in the same direction.
Further, it is necessary to recognize that strategies do not occur on a continuum; rather, each strategy is
discrete. There is a repertoire of strategies, the nature of which must be properly understood if any serious
attempt is to be made to reduce alcohol and other drug-related harm. Homel, Miller and MacAvoy (1992)
state: "The critical point is that no single strategy is likely to be as effective as a coordinated approach that
focuses on preventing the problem and reducing harm itself rather than the constituent elements causing
the harm." Therefore it is not a simple matter of moving down the intervention hierarchy until a successful
intervention is identified.


GOALS OF HARM MINIMIZATION


A further complicating factor when considering the concept of harm minimization is that of the
determination of intervention goals. Harm minimization allows for multiple goals depending on the harms
which are identified for targeting. These goals themselves vary over time in accordance with the dynamic
nature of drug use patterns and consequences. It may be artificial to consider harm on a continuum. In
reality, different types ofharm are quite discrete, and no objective or absolute assessment of harm may be
made. The different types of harm are assigned different values by different individuals and communities
as well as across different cultures. The evaluation of harm reduction strategies needs not only to focus on
the outcomes that the strategies are aiming to modify but also to recognize that such strategies may impact
on other outcomes. In other words, a specific strategy may result in different outcomes on separate harm
reduction measures. Newcombe (1991) provides examples of the complexity of evaluating such strategies.
One example describes a mass media campaign used to reduce the risks associated with the inhalation of
volatile solvents by informing the general population about the use of inhalants. A possible outcome may
be an increase in the number of young people trying solvents but with a decrease in the number of deaths
and health problems actually experienced by the users. To that particular community, what is an acceptable
prevalence of volatile substance use considering the reduction in morbidity and mortality? There is
obviously no simple evaluative framework that can be utilized for assessing the overall impact of such
strategies.


The example of volatile solvents as presented above raises an issue which requires further discussion. A
commonly ~ited argument against the harm reduction concept relates to the risks associated with metamessages used in prevention programmes. The appropriateness of providing messages on such specific
harm reduction strategies as needle and syringe exchange, safe drug use practices and controlled drinking
through mass media campaigns may be questioned. It is argued that such messages may negatively
influence non-users, particularly youth who may be at a stage of pre-experimentation. In such cases, a more
appropriate approach may be the combination of an abstinence meta-message with specific harm reduction
messages targeting high-risk populations or current drug users. A harm minimization policy has the
potential to undermine the acceptability or desirability of an abstinence goal that in some cultures may be
the preferred outcome. For example, a policy of "sensible" drinking, with meta-messages stating "safe" or


WHO/PSA/93 .10
page 138


"sensible" levels of alcohol consumption, is likely to be inappropriate and may even accentuate alcoholrelated problems in many developing countries where there are no well-established traditions of alcohol use
and control. Further research is necessary to determine the impact of alcohol in developing countries and
to compare the possible outcomes, both positive and negative, of interventions aiming for abstinence versus
those with a harm reduction aim (Partenan, 1988).


Associated with the emergence of the concept of harm minimization has been the concept of "risk
reduction". This concept focuses on particular behaviours that may result in harmful outcomes, rather than
on the outcomes themselves. It may be a more useful concept for measuring the efficacy of intervention
strategies than that of harm minimization.


**ILLUSTRATING THE CONCEPT**


The wide-ranging utility of harm minimization as an overall objective may be illustrated by three case
studies, one on injecting drug use, one on drinking-driving and one on criminal justice.


There are multiple risks associated with injecting drug use. These may be prioritized according to the level
of risk or the severity of consequent harm to the individual, the family and the community. For example,
a community may identify the following problems: the public health risk of disease transmission, such as
HIV and hepatitis, through the sharing of injecting equipment; the risk to the individual of overdose and
other toxic effects due to the variability in the purity of, and the adulteration of, illicit drugs; the risk of
tissue damage through actual injecting practices; the harm and economic costs to the local community
through criminal behaviour; the risk of drug dependency in the individual user; the risk to the general public
of discarded used needles and syringes; the anguish experienced by the user's family; disruption within the
workplace; and visual annoyance at seeing drug users inject in public. Once the problems have been
identified, goal hierarchies for each problem may be formulated along with appropriate strategies for
intervention. With the problem of disease transmission, the intervention goals may range from the cleaning
of injecting equipment between use to the cessation of needle sharing, through to changing the route of drug
administration or total abstinence from drug use. Strategies employed would thus range from educating
drug users on how to clean equipment, the distribution of bleach, the provision of clean needles and
syringes, making available purer forms of the drug which may be taken by other routes than injecting, the
provision of drug substitutes such as methadone, through to drug-free treatment. For each of the other
problems identified, similar goal hierarchies and intervention strategies may be formulated. They should
not be regarded as exclusive but rather complimentary to one another. Cultural limitations need to be
recognized when determining hierarchies and strategies. In this case, for developing countries, it is likely
that it would be more realistic to develop education strategies for users on cleaning techniques than to try
to secure resources for the distribution of new needles and syringes.


A further example is the issue of drinking and driving. It is easy to identify that the problems are those
associated with alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes and consequent morbidity and mortality. The range
of goals may include establishing a safer driving environment to minimize the harm which may result from
those who drink and drive. Strategies could include safer roads and cars with impact inflation bags. A
fiuther goal may be to try to reduce the amount of alcohol that drivers consume. Strategies may include the
promotion of low alcohol beverages, lower pricing of low alcohol beverages, server intervention


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 139


programmes, the location of breath analyzers at drinking venues, random roadside breath testing and
preventive education campaigns. Interventions may be aimed at preventing those who have consumed
excessive amounts of alcohol, from driving. Possible strategies may include car ignition interlocks,
"buddy" systems where non-drinkers volunteer to drive drinking friends home and driver assessment and
intervention programmes for those who have been apprehended for drinking-driving. Another goal may
be to prevent those who drink from driving. Strategies may include the provision of adequate public
transport to drinking venues and discouraging driving by not making car parking facilities available at such
venues. At the top of the hierarchy may be the goal of preventing the consumption of any alcohol by those
who propose to drive. Strategies may include the promotion of alcohol-free beverages at functions and
drinking venues, and the use of public education campaigns and the banning of alcohol advertising in an
effort to alter social norms and expectancies about drinking and driving.


The health and welfare sectors do not have exclusive right to the harm minimization concept. It is a concept
which may be applied to all aspects of drug-related harm and adopted by the full range of individuals and
agencies that have contact with drug users, including the criminal justice system. Pearson ( 1991) proposes
that the criminal justice system has four main roles to play in the reduction of drug related harm:


11 The containment of the numbers of new users recruited into the system through effective and
focused low-level policing in conjunction with other prevention strategies.


The encouragement of existing users to take 'early retirement' from drug-using careers, and to
enter treatment programmes which include maintenance prescribing as an intermediate objective.


The minimization of counter-productive aspects of enforcement strategies through arrest-referral
schemes, diversion programmes and other community-based activities which avoid the excessive
use of custodial measures and enhance the prospects of rehabilitation.


The minimization of harm to the wider community, by a reduction of crime committed by users
in· order to sustain their habits."


These three very different examples demonstrate the broad utility of the harm minimization concept and
how it may be applied as an overall objective as compared to its use exclusively in referring to specific harm
reduction strategies. The concept has equal validity with regard to both licit and illicit drugs, and it may
be used to examine the roles of different community sectors in responding to identified problems. However,
the concept does have significant limitations when looking beyond the industrialized world where most
debate has occurred. Most examples used for describing the principles of harm minimization draw on the
experiences of well-resourced developed countries, typically citing activities surrounding the issue of HIV
infection, such as needle and syringe exchange and methadone maintenance programmes. Such measures
are resource prohibitive and culturally inappropriate for most developing countries (Shinfuku, 1992).
Although many developing countries have adopted a "zero tolerance" approach to drug use (and many
Muslim countries take this attitude to alcohol) with a focus on the eradication of drug use, a historical
review of drug policies in some of these countries demonstrates the past adoption of a range of strategies
that have aimed to reduce drug-related harm. Most notable has been the controlled provision of opiates to
opiate "addicts" in countries such as Pakistan and China. Currently, there are frequent reports, from various
countries in South and South-East Asia, of clinicians utilizing the concept of drug substitution by providing


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 140


opiwn to individuals with heroin dependence. Evidence of increasing injecting drug use and resultant HN
infection in Asia, and to a lesser extent in Latin America and Western Africa, has provided a reason for
examining the role of specific harm reduction strategies in the developing world (Poshyachinda, 1992). As
developing countries work towards the development of national drug policies and strategies, there is an
urgent need for a clear understanding of where the overall concept of harm minimization may be positioned
within these societies.


The concept of harm minimization is not new for either the developed or the developing world. Only
recently, however, has the concept been clearly articulated so broadly at international level. It is an issue
that has stirred intense debate. O'Hare ( 1991) states that "harm reduction is not merely a debate over
treatment ... the principle has implication for the future shape of drug control systems". Such a model of
harm minimization, as compared to the traditional market model of demand and supply, allows for the issue
to be positioned within a health and social welfare context. It also allows for the introduction of a more
relevant evaluation framework in which the success of an intervention is determined by the direct health and
social indicators that relate to a reduction in drug risk or drug-related harm rather than by the use of the
indirect indicator of a change in the level of drug use.

VII. MUTUAL HELP FOR THE RECOVERY OF ALCOHOL
AND DRUG ABUSE


INTRODUCTION


Mutual aid groups are a prominent aspect of contemporary life. An increasing number of people, both in
developed and developing countries, are helping one another solve their problems. There are groups for
the mentally ill, the physically handicapped, those who eat too much or who do not eat at all, gamblers,
smokers and those who abuse alcohol and other drugs.


It was estimated in I990 that 15 million North Americans participated in more than half a million self-help
groups, many of them specific to recovery from dependence (Yoder, 1990). One survey reported that
almost one-tenth of _the_ adult US population had had direct exposure to a _meeting_ of Alcoholics Anonymous
at some point, although of these only one-third had had alcohol problems of their own. When non-alcoholoriented groups _were_ included, it was found that _more_ than one-eighth of the population (13.3%) had
attended a 12-step meeting (Room & Greenfield, 1993).


Although the effectiveness of self-help groups rests largely upon personal testimonials, they have become
a salient feature of today's service scene and of society in general. They fulfil functions in today's society
that _were_ once served by family, church and service professionals.


Self-help and mutual aid are respected American values, reflecting the country's image of problem solving.
Self-help is related to several other fundamental American values such as "individualism", "voluntarism"
and "antistatism" (Hurvitz, 1976). Each stresses the rights and obligations of the private person, either
alone or in voluntary association with others, and in opposition to an intrusive authority (Nurco &
Makofsky, 1981). However, although this is true for the USA, self-help organizations in many other
countries have developed according to their different backgrounds.


The most striking characteristics of self-help protagonists are their independence and distrust of
professionals. The organizational structure of self-help groups replaces professional elitism with member
solidarity and group autonomy. The bureaucracy and professionalism prevalent in regular service
organizations are replaced with reciprocity and direct democratic participation (NIDA, 1978; Room, 1993).


HISTORICAL ASPECTS


Mutual aid, assistance, cooperation and natural support systems have existed from time immemorial. In
contradiction to the predator theory of Social Darwinism, Kropotkin (Katz & Bender, 1976) pointed out
that tribal or clan societies survived because of mores and laws that supported cooperative action. The very
condition of civilization lay in humanity's early development of cooperation through food-gathering and the
maintenance of a group for safety and defence. The village community was developed by stronger clans
that practised these habits while less united clans disintegrated.


Later, mutual aid groups expanded their activities beyond physical survival. By the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance, the physically or mentally disabled, as well as strangers and pilgrims, relied on church and
town charities. Various structured organizations such as guilds, trade unions and reform groups played an
important role in the development of the relief laws for the poor that extended statutory welfare and health
benefits.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 144


The Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on the social, economic and health problems of a
growing population. The Friendly Societies which followed the guilds were unique institutions where
working people in different occupational groups could fmd help in coping with the stress of industrialism.
The Incorporation of Carters (1550), the Fraternity of Dyers (1670) and the Goldsmith Friendly Society
( 1712) were just a few of the 191 Friendly Societies founded before 1800. Both unions and Friendly
Societies were the main mutual-aid organizations of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Their main
purpose was to attend to the economic needs of their members, but they were also concerned with other
issues such as social and political improvement.


Structurally speaking, these multifunctional societies were organized and directed locally - characteristics
similar to those of some contemporary self-help groups. Friendly Societies, cooperatives of workers and
trade unions, were early expressions of self-help organizations devoted to helping their members with
housing and work problems, burial and loan arrangements and health and pension plans. Immigrant groups
arriving in the USA after 1880 organized their own mutual aid organizations to cope with the numerous
problems and needs they faced in their efforts to adjust to their new life (Katz & Bender, 1976).


In the 20th century, especially after the Second World War, many new expressions of the self-help
phenomenon arose, less related to economic survival than to existential issues. The main goal of most of
these organizations was solving personal problems through inner change, though political advocacy was
the concern of others. Both old and new self-help organizations have an impact on the personal views and
on the practical aspects of the lives of the participants. The main differences between them are the criteria
for membership and their relations with the outside world. In the self-help groups of the 19th century in
England, members were already tied by their social and economic background; in the new self-help groups,
membership was based upon individual experience, independent of social position, occupation or race
(Makela, 1992).


As self-help movements have developed, the fmal stage is one of bureaucratization and professionalization
(Katz, 1961 ). Nevertheless, there are many exceptions to this model among the new self-help organizations,
such as Alcoholics Anonymous and others (Bloomfield, 1991). Their growth and expansion to many
countries during recent decades has changed neither their non-hierarchic and non-bureaucratic structure,
nor their independence from the outside world (Makela, 1993).


Among contemporary groups that practise mutual aid are the natural and informal social networks of
family, workmates, schoolmates, neighbours and friends. In addition, there is a wide range of self-organized
and self-directing educational, healing, economic and socially supportive groups (Katz, 1981).


DEFINITIONS AND TYPOLOGIES


Among the many definitions of self-help groups, the following is probably the most widely cited:


"Self-help groups are voluntary, small group structures for mutual aid and the
accomplishment of a special purpose. They are usually formed by peers who have come
together for mutual assistance in satisfYing a common need, overcoming a common handicap
of life-disrupting problem, and bringing about desired social and/or personal change. The
initiators and members of such groups perceive that their needs are not, or cannot be, met by
or through the existing social institutions. Self-help groups emphasize face to face social
interactions and the assumption of personal responsibility by members. They often provide
material assistance, as well as emotional support; they are frequently ·cause' oriented and


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 145


promulgate an ideology or values through which members may attain an enhanced sense of
personal identity" (Katz & Bender, 1976).


The main attributes that defme these groups are their spontaneous origin, that they are not usually set up
by an outside initiative, and that they always involve face-to-face interactions and personal participation.
Bureaucratization is antithetical to the self-help organization: members agree on and engage in activities.
Typically, groups fill the participants' need for a reference group, for a point of connection and
identification with others, and for a base of activity and source of ego-reinforcement.


Through these attributes, self-help groups differ from "mutual aid" groupings and agreements i.e. those
exercising political or economic power, such as unions, cartels, corporation boards, "old boys" networks
and friendship cliques. The groups are distinguished also from various voluntary membership
organizations, such as "service organizations", which are oriented towards traditional philanthropy. The
definition excludes such temporary or unplanned natural associations as children playing together, the shortlived "emergency collectivism" of neighbours in times of natural disasters, and the "encounter group", since
these transient groups lack the necessary "common problem", "specific purpose" and "ideology"
(Helmerson, 1989).


There are several types of primary focus mutual-help groups. These include groups oriented towards
individual change or personal growth (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous, Women For Sobriety), groups that focus
on protecting alternative patterns of living or identities (e.g. gay activists, women's movements, ethnic
support groups), groups oriented more towards social advocacy, the promotion of change or enforcement
of laws (e.g. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and organizations that focus on providing support for the
stress and pressures due to life in society (e.g. groups of single parents or ex-prisoners). A differentiation
can also be made between those groups that seek a withdrawal from deviance through self-change (e.g.
Narcotics Anonymous) and other groups that seek to modify the definition of deviance, thus condemning
society rather than themselves (e.g. Junkiebond).


Self-help groups dedicated to personal change, such as those for people with alcohol and drug problems,
all include the key element of self-disclosure. In other words, the process of recovery requires that members
of the group acknowledge their faults and inner sufferings and make "public" what used to be "private".
This self-disclosure facilitates healing through a process of identification with others "like me". Another
important feature of these groups is that they are based on the principle of peer support which is why they
are also called mutual-help groups.


For the purposes of this chapter, the mutual-help recovery resources for people with alcohol and drug
problems will be classified as follows:


- groups with the same principles and ideology as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), known as 12-steps
organizations;

- groups inspired by AA but which have modified the AA ideology and the principles;

- mutual-help organizations with no connection to AA and a different background;

- other resources for alcohol and drug abuse treatment that include a self-help component.


This classification serves to categorize the large number of different examples of mutual-aid. Most selfhelp groups began in the USA, where they have become an important feature of the therapeutic arena and
society in the last four decades. It is here that most information is available on mutual-help resources. This
chapter, however, includes all information available from other parts of the world.

ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS AND OTHER 12-STEPS SELF-HELP GROUPS


Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has a worldwide membership of more than 1. 7 million, has established groups
in more than 100 countries (mainly industrialized, non-socialist and non-Islamic societies) which have an
annual membership growth of 6.6% in the USA and Canada, and 15% in the rest of the world (Miikela,

1993). These numbers indicate the enormous impact AA has had since its appearance in 1935 and of its
ability to involve and help alcohol-dependent persons. AA's effectiveness has been described from various
perspectives in a great deal of literature, in which it is seen as a charismatic organization, a cognitive
therapy and a new social movement (Back & Taylor, 1976; Antze, 1976; Boscarino, 1980; Ogborne &
Glaser, 1981; Glaser, 1982; Robinson, 1983; Galanter, 1990; Room, 1993). Most self-help organizations
dealing in substance abuse, behavioural, or emotional problems are the issue of AA ideology. Its history
is well documented by the organization's major texts and by many scientists interested in the AA
phenomenon (AA, 1939; AA, 1957; Glaser, 1981; Kurtz, 1982; Peterson, 1992).


AA Background


The direct origins of AA are the Oxford Groups, a revivalist religious fellowship led by Lutheran minister
Frank Buchman in the early part of this century. These small groups, independent of traditionally organized
churches, stressed the search for moral and spiritual values. Members improved their lives through
conversion, prayer and meditation.


Many alcohol-dependent persons attended those meetings for the help they found in achieving and
maintaining sobriety. Among them was one of the eo-founders of AA, Bill Wilson. The teachings and
methods ofBuchman are contained in the book _Soul Surgery_ and were influenced by the development of
AA. There are several similarities between the Oxford groups' principles and procedures and those of AA:
a step-like approach to the conversion/recovery process; confrontation of the denial of sin/alcoholdependence through person-to-person confession; meetings in informal, friendly settings, separate from
religious institutions; maintenance of conversion/recovery through work with the as yet
unconverted/unrecovered; use of an illness model to describe sin/alcohol-dependence; identification of
selfishness or self-centeredness as the root of sin/alcohol-dependence; avoidance of theological discussions
while insisting that recovery depends on reliance on "God" or a "higher power" as defmed by the recovering
individual (Hurvitz, 1976; Glaser, 1981; Peterson, 1992).


Buchman developed his step-by-step approach as a missionary in China. This method uses the Five C's:
confidence, confession, conviction, conversion and continuance. This approach is the acknowledged
inspiration of AA's 12-steps.


Founding of AA


By sharing their experiences of alcohol dependence and their desire to better their lives, founders of AA
(Bill Wilson and Dr Bob Smith) and other alcohol-dependents discovered that they were able to remain
sober. The principles of the Oxford Groups, plus the reading of William James's _The Varieties_ _of_
_Religious Experiences,_ furthered their knowledge of how an alcohol-dependent person could recover. In
1935, they initiated their legacies of recovery, unity and service, as well as the AA basics- a 12-step
programme for personal recovery, the 12 traditions for the survival and unity of AA groups, and the 12
concepts of worldwide service that guarantee help to the alcoholic-dependent. Several books and pamphlets
lay down and explain these principles and are considered the basic AA literature.

The AA Programme


Alcoholics Anonymous is a system of beliefs and interactions (Mak.ela, 1991). As a belief system, it does
not advocate any eschatological, theological or ontological concepts. AA interests itself only in this life and
the relationships of an individual to himsel:tlherself, to other people and to some "higher power". It is clear,
however, that Christian and especially Protestant traditions and world views have had an important
influence on AA and on its spread to other societies with similar backgrounds.


The AA belief system gradually changes the newcomer's world view and perception of himself/herself.
Newcomers admit they are powerless over alcohol and that their lives have become unmanageable.
Surrendering and acceptance of the inability to control both alcohol use and one's life are key to this frrst
step, which solves the problem of denial, resulting in a new, controlled self. However, the change is
spiritual, based on the belief in a "higher power", according to each person's understanding (steps 2-3). It
is necessary to honestly make a moral inventory, admitting one's faults to God and to other human beings
(steps 4-5). An honest will to change one's imperfections should manifest itself, as well as a willingness
to make amends and repair the harm caused others (steps 6-9). One is continually required to analyze one's
life, mending errors with God's help and helping other alcohol-dependents who are still suffering (steps 1 0
12).


Although AA claims to be "spiritual" and not "religious", the programme represents a fmding of or a reencounter with God. Many members view AA as a "religion" while for others the "higher power" may mean
a cosmic principle or even the group itself. Beliefs and actions go together as both the newcomer and the
long-term member are in the same danger of relapse. The sharing of experiences at a meeting, following
the 12-step principles and sponsoring other members are constant reminders of "where I was". By praying
or referring to a "higher power", one learns to believe in it.


There is also an "AA discourse" that helps the alcohol-dependent to re-think his/her life and rebuild both
the past and the present on AA's beliefs and interactions. Rituals, slogans and mottos are used, although
they may vary from one group, or culture, to another. Honesty and humility are required basics of the
programme, along with interaction and sharing with other members. There is an emphasis on the
individual's responsibility to lead a constructive and moral life, and meditation and prayer are encouraged.


Alcoholics Anonymous sees the alcohol-dependent person as an individual who needs to change his/her
personality and alcohol-dependence as a disease (although not clearly defined) of "mind, body and soul".
Besides hope, the newcomer fmds a social network (or "social cocoon") that will help him/her keep to the
programme, and avoid loneliness when coping with the desire to drink or other problems in life. The AA
programme of living in sobriety and not merely abstinence becomes a way of life.


Psychologically, AA members progress through a series of coping mechanisms which are necessary to deal
constructively with abstinence, self-image and interpersonal relationships. Newcomers are advised to attend
as many meetings as possible and work through the programme on a daily basis ("just these 24 hours").
All members are encouraged to be active in the rota of "service" for the group (serving as "coffee maker",
treasurer or secretary) or at other levels of the service structure (as a representative or a delegate of the
group) and to follow the 12-step programme.


The AA meeting


The AA meeting is informal, yet much more structured than many other gatherings. The format and the
interactions vary widely not only from country to country but also within a society. Regular meetings last
from one to one and a half hours. The number of meetings a group holds may vary from once a week to
several meetings each day. A group may hold "closed meetings" for AA members only, or "open meetings"


WHO/PSA/93 .1 0
page 148


for when newcomers and non-AA members are also present. There are meetings to "study the AA
literature" or to celebrate "anniversaries" of members. Meetings take place in various types of facilities,
varying from group to group.


Interactions at the meetings are based on a non-written, but specific set of rules of speech and behaviour
(such as the absence of cross-talk when someone is "sharing"). The newcomer learns these after attending
a few meetings. A few examples are: to talk in turn, to speak only about personal experiences, to avoid
giving lectures about scientific theories or religious doctrines, and to avoid giving advice to other members
or denouncing the programme.


The opening and closing of the meeting generally include the reading of some fragment of the AA literature
by the meeting coordinator. At the end a basket circulates for voluntary contributions. Some groups begin
with a moment of silence, others conclude with the "Serenity prayer". At the close of some meetings,
members make a circle holding hands, while at others members only shake hands. In some groups the
"Lords Prayer" is included. After the meeting, many members go to the "meeting after the meeting" or
"coffee therapy" in a nearby cafe or restaurant.


AA as an organization


The independence of AA as an organization, its lack of strong bureaucracy and the practice of direct
participation all seem to have played key roles in the movement's growth and permanence. Although in AA
there are no authorities, long-term members with charismatic or strong personalities are informal leaders
and role models.


Alcoholics Anonymous is based on a cell structure. This means that each group is autonomous and
independent but open to anyone wanting to stop drinking. A group has a life of its own - it may grow or
fade out, it may divide or join with another spontaneously. There are no records or membership fees,
funding coming from voluntary contributions (the 7th tradition). This cell and network structure has played
a central role in the strength and spread of AA (Miikela, 1992; Miikela, 1993).


Since AA groups are open to anybody wanting to quit drinking, the social and demographic composition
of membership varies widely. Each member chooses to stay in the group where he/she feels most
comfortable. In recent decades AA has been able to adjust to the many changes taking place within every
society. This has resulted, especially in the USA, in a variety of "special interest" groups, such as gay
groups, all women groups, groups for young people, for ethnic minorities, for persons of different
occupational status, for the deaf, and so on. Mexico has also shown some signs of diversification, with
some mixed sex groups holding an "all women meeting" once a week. There are two "gays only" groups
in Mexico City (Rosovsky, 1992).


Spread of AA


Though AA was viewed as an "American by-product for the white, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant alcoholic",
it has expanded rapidly during recent decades to different cultures. In 1986, 53.8% of AA members
worldwide were in the USA and Canada, 5.2% were in other anglophone countries, 1.3% in Scandinavia,
4.6% in other European countries, 34.5% in Latin American and 0.8% in all other countries (Miikela, 1993).
AA typically spread through American AA members who visited or emigrated to other countries or through
alcohol-dependent persons who learned of the programme while in the USA.


Alcoholics Anonymous first spread to other anglophone countries, where the original English AA literature
could be used. These countries generally had developed economies, strong Protestant traditions and close
contact with the USA. This gave support to the view of AA as a continuation of the temperance tradition,


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 149


characteristic ofEnglish-speaking and Nordic countries, where distilled liquor was the dominant beverage
and Protestantism the dominant religion (Robinson, 1983; Levine, in press). After the 1960s AA spread
to countries with different backgrounds. AA is now strong in Catholic countries which have a high level
of beer consumption, but tends to have fewer groups in traditional wine-drinking cultures (Makela, 1991).


In Western Europe almost all countries have a growing number of AA groups. The exception is Denmark
which has a poor AA presence. During the period of Soviet influence, AA groups were not present in
Eastern European countries. Now, along with recent sociopolitical changes, there are signs of the spread
of AA to Poland and some countries of the former Soviet Union. In Italy, Spain and Portugal, which are
Catholic countries with high wine consumption, AA activities have begun to rise during the last two
decades.


In almost all countries of the Americas there are AA groups. Only in Cuba were AA activities still
unknown by 1986. Mexican AA members recently visited to initiate a relationship. AA was introduced
early to several countries in Latin America. By the mid-1940s there were AA groups in Colombia, El
Salvador and Mexico. Only in Haiti, Chile and Bolivia are AA activities still insignificant.


In many Asian countries AA is practically unknown and, where some AA groups are present, the
membership may represent foreigners living there. In Hong Kong, for instance, only one of 16 weekly AA
meetings was held in Chinese (Makela, 1991 ). In Africa, only South Africa shows a considerable presence
of AA. In New Zealand, AA was introduced in the late 1940s and had around 300 groups by 1986.
Australia almost tripled the number of groups between 1965 and 1986. Other countries of Oceania had no
AA activities in 1986.


The publishing activities of AA played an important role in the spread of the programme. The AA World
Office in New York has helped different countries to develop their own service structure and has given them
the right to translate and publish the literature in their own language.


The AA model of recovery has been applied to a variety of other problems, such as dependence on other
substances or to help the relatives and friends of the alcohol and drug abuser. Although most of these
organizations are operating in the USA, the ones listed below have a certain degree of international
influence.


Narcotics Anonymous


Narcotics Anonymous (NA) is the largest self-help effort available to narcotic-dependent persons in the
USA. NA was founded in 1953 and its World Service office is located in California.


Narcotic Anonymous is based on the 12-step programme of AA. Three of the 5-member committee who
created NA also belonged to AA. It seems that one of the main reasons for creating NA was that AA
members objected to the discussion of drug-related subjects at their meetings. Both alcohol-dependents and
drug dependents perceived the need for another organization. Many of the NA founders have remained
members of AA as well. Similarities with AA can be seen in many practices, in that NA members accept
the 12 steps and traditions, substituting drug terms for AA references to alcohol.


Although NA claims not to follow the AA structure, essentially it has adopted the AA programme (Nurco
& Makofsky, 1981). There are several chapters ofNA in over 50 countries, with more than 22 000 groups
in 1991. In addition, more than 2000 meetings are held in correctional and treatment facilities.


WHO/PSA/93 .I 0
page 150


During the last few years NA has begun to have a growing number of groups in Latin America and Europe.
There areNA groups in Eastern Europe and in some Asian countries. The NA literature has been translated
into many languages (NA, 1992).


Cocaine Anonymous


Cocaine Anonymous (CA) is another AA-derived self-help organization founded in 1982 in the USA for
the purpose of giving support to the cocaine user and his/her specific problems. In 1992 CA had 1500
international chapters (The Self-Help Sourcebook, 1992).


There are other international organizations based on AA's 12-steps programme of AA, but these mutualhelp groups have, up to now, had less impact than the above, particularly outside the USA. Some examples
are Smokers Anonymous (founded in 1982 in California, with more than 500 groups in the USA) and Pill
Addicts Anonymous (founded in 1979 in the USA, with only six groups in 1992) (Y oder, 1990).


Twelve-steps groups for the family of the dependent person


Relatives and friends of alcohol or drug dependents may also find help in self-help groups. Among those
based on the philosophy and programme of AA, the first was AI-Anon which was created in 1951 by the
spouses of the two founders of AA. Their main idea was that the family, as well as the alcohol-dependents
need help, since alcohol-dependence "is a family disease" and relatives may experience stress and emotional
suffering. A1-Anon's founders felt that they needed to apply the principles of the AA programme to deal
with the problems of adjusting to life with an active or sober alcohol-dependent.


The first family groups had different names such as AA auxiliary or Triple A but in 195 2 the name of AlAnon Family Groups was chosen. The organization is independent of AA and has its own offices and own
literature (Lois Remembers, 1987). More than 32 000 Al-Anon groups meet in around 100 countries.
Wherever there is AA Al-Anon is probably present too (Rosenqvist, 1992).


Alateen, founded in 1957, is a fellowship of young Al-Anon members, usually teenage children of alcoholdependents. It is affiliated withAl-Anon.


Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA), is a 12-step programme for adults who, as children in the home
of an alcohol-dependent, have grown up with emotional distress that is an impediment to full participation
in adult life. ACOA was founded in 1976 in the USA. Its groups may be affiliated to Al-Anon or to
another international organization, Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACA), which was founded in 1984 and
has more than 1350 groups in five countries. Both Al-Anon and ACOA attract not only the children of
alcohol-dependents, but also people who grew up with other kinds of family dysfunction such as violence
or mental illness (Yoder, 1990).


The ACOA programme aims to help people raised by alcohol-dependent parents without consistent models
of adulthood or healthy relationships. Through inattention and neglect, many ACOA members develop low
self-esteem and lack of maturity in their relationships (Miller & Tuchfeld, 1986). The ACOA groups have
not spread out of the USA as widely as Al-Anon. Many individuals with these problems also attend AlAnon meetings.


Nar-Anon (an international group, founded in 1967) and Co-Anon (an international group, with more than
42 groups, founded in 1985) are the respective self-help resources for the relatives or friends of drug
dependent persons and cocaine abusers (The Self-Help Sourcebook, 1992).


WHO/PSA/93.1 0

page 151


Another growing mutual-help movement for friends or relatives ofpeople with alcohol or drug dependency,
is Families Anonymous (FA), founded in 1971 in the USA. It is also based on AA's 12 steps and
traditions. Families Anon}TI1ous gives support to relatives or friends of people who abuse alcohol or drugs
or who have behavioural problems. FA has a large number of publications, more than 300 groups in the
USA and has spread to many countries (Galanter, 1984; Families Anon}TI1ous hie., 1991).


SELF-HELP GROUPS THAT HAVE MODIFIED AA PRINCIPLES


There are other mutual-help organizations inspired by the AA philosophy and methods which for various
reasons have changed some aspects of the AA programme. These groups may have a special social or
religious focus or they may be restricted to the USA or to other specific areas. Some lack the "spontaneity"
typical of other self-help organizations.


Women for sobriety


Women for Sobriety (WFS) is an association of self-help groups for alcohol-dependent women. It was
founded in the USA in 1975 by Jean Kirkpatrick, a Ph.D. member of AA, to meet the recovery needs
specific to women. WFS is largely influenced by feminist philosophy. There were 250-300 groups with
approximately 5000 members in the USA in 1989. "Turnabout" is the autobiography written by
Kirkpatrick about her drinking history. She points out that alcohol-dependent women need to rebuild their
self-confidence and self-esteem and that they suffer from a harsh social prejudice.


The "New Life Program" of WFS is based on 13 affirmations that can be summarized as no drinking,
positive thinking, believing one is competent, and growing spiritually and emotionally. The most important
differences between AA and WFS is the view of female recovery from alcohol-dependence as a process of
building self-esteem because women have been humiliated by society. · Therefore, unlike AA, the WFS
emphasis is not on humility but on competence and building one's self-control instead of on surrender. The
meetings take a different form from those of AA (Kaskutas, 1989). Many women alcohol-dependents
attend both AA and WFS meetings. Others feel uncomfortable speaking at mixed AA meetings or fmd
more support, acceptance and nurture in WFS than in AA (Yoder, 1990).


Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS)


Like many other organizations Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) was also founded in southern
California by a recovering alcohol dependent who hoped to provide an alternative to AA for people who
could not accept the "God or higher power issue" of the AA programme. Persons dependent on other
substances are also accepted in SOS. Within two years SOS had grown to include about 5000 members
in 80 groups throughout the USA, with new groups forming in Australia, Great Britain and Canada. SOS
groups meet once a week for an hour and a half and discuss topics drawn from secular literature or from
the book "How To Stay Sober: Recovery Without Religion" by SOS founder, James Christopher (Yoder,
1990). The SOS programme is based on six suggested guidelines that encourage members to accept the
fact that the dependents, stay clean and sober one day at a time, to see sobriety as a lifelong priority, to be
responsible for achieving a life free of alcohol or drugs and to share thoughts and feelings with other
members. Some SOS members also attend AA meetings.


Another mutual-help organization that claims to be international and which has modified the AA
programme is Overcomers Outreach which was founded in California in 1985 as a "Christian ministry
of self-help for persons who could benefit from a secular 12 step group in the Christian community; it
includes alcoholics, drug addicts, overeaters, gamblers, co-dependents, etc." Overcomers Outreach claims


WHOIPSA/93 .1 0
page 152


to have 943 affiliated groups. Still another organization is the Calix Society, founded in Minneapolis,
Minnesota in 194 7 as an adjunct to AA to give support to recovering alcohol dependents seeking spiritual
development through the Catholic church Small groups of Calix members meet regularly with a priest who
serves as spiritual director. The Calix Society includes religious activities such as celebrating the liturgy,
receiving the sacraments, prayer, meditation and retreats. Members may include non-dependent persons
with a personal interest in the disease, and they receive the bi-monthly newsletter _The Chalice._ Calix units
have been established in 70 cities throughout the USA, as well as in Canada and Great Britain (The SelfHelp Sourcebook, 1992).


Links


In Sweden, Denmark and Norway there is the AA-influenced Links organization, though in the ftrst two
countries it was founded before the AA. The main goal of the Links is to help alcohol dependents (Kurube,
1992a).


The first society of Links in Sweden was founded in 1945, eight years before the Swedish AA. The initiator
was an inspector at the Temperance Board in Stockholm who had read an article on AA in _Reader's Digest._
He gathered together seven recovered alcohol dependents from different temperance organizations plus the
Oxford group team.


The Swedish Links has received financial support since 1947 from the municipality of Stockholm and state
grants since 1952. From its beginnings the society of Links had contacts with the AA movement in the
USA. Currently the Swedish Links is initiating efforts to establish international collaboration with other
mutual-help groups not related with the AA 12-step programme, Sobriety International. (The purpose of

Sobriety International is to address issues of alcohol policy around the world. While politically and
religiously independent, it supports WHO's aim to reduce alcohol consumption in the European Region of
countries by 25% by the year 2000, legislation for a zero alcohol level for drivers and restrictions on alcohol
advertisement (Kurube, 1 992b).)


By 1990, the Swedish Links had some 17 500 members, including support members. Danish Links had
a membership level of 5000 and Norwegian Links 300. In Denmark, working people with alcohol problems
who had heard about AA in Sweden, founded in 1948 the Links organization (formerly Ring in Ring). They
did not accept the disease concept of alcohol dependence but considered it a cultural and social problem.
Professionals were involved in the group's development, because Ring in Ring which became Links in 1962,
ran its own outpatient clinics (Kurube, 1992b). The Norwegian Links were founded on the initiative of
one of the Swedish Links groups in 1979 (Kurube, 1992a).


The Links programme in Sweden and Norway is a shortened and partly modifted version of AA's 12 steps.
The Links seven-points differs from AA's steps on the issue of the "higher power". Instead, Links members
put their faith in the group's solidarity and strength to achieve and maintain sobriety.


In a different fashion, the Danish Links created a treatment model, strongly influenced by professionals,
by which the psychological roots of drinking are acknowledged and the alcohol dependent is oriented to
understand his/her drinking mechanisms. Links members include alcohol dependent persons and support
members such as the family.


Danshukai


In Japan, theDanshukai or Association for Quitting Drinking has its origins in the temperance movement
but incorporates AA principles. The initiative for the temperance movement in Japan came from Protestant


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 153


missionaries who founded the First Temperance Association in ToJ...")'o in 1887. In 1950, contacts with AA
were made and in 1953 the first Friend's Association for Quitting Drinking was founded within the national
Federation of Temperance Associations.


Besides the temperance movement and AA, the medical profession also influenced the creation of
Danshukai. The principles of AA were modified in relation to anonymity, formalization of structure and
membership fees on the basis that it was necessary to adjust the AA programme to Japanese culture.
Danshukai's, "Programme for a New Life" has many similarities with the seven points of Links. This
Japanese programme focuses on the importance of meetings, mutual respect for others' personalities and
shared spiritual kinship. The central points are personal change and the creation of a new life. The spiritual
dimension of the programme is strongly related to Japanese religious philosophy.


Danshukai's local associations evolved from patients' clubs in treatment clinics and receive professional
supervision. Nevertheless, in Japan medical professionals are more likely to refer people to AA than to
Danshukai, so rivalry does exist between the two movements. The higher status that AA seems to have
among young doctors may reflect a shift in traditional Japanese thinking from the importance of the group
to the importance of the individual.


Danshukai's activities include moulding opinion on matters related to alcohol. From its beginning,
Danshukai has called for legislature on alcohol treatment and to provide fmancial means to the association.
Danshukai has some 40 000 members, including support and family members (Kurube, 1992b ).


Although the organizations described in this section were inspired by the 12-step movement, modifications
made to the recovery programmes and activities stemmed from other philosophies such as feminism or
temperance, from the workers movement, or from the practices and beliefs of the Catholic church or other
religious traditions. In some cases, the changes to the AA programme resulted from the influence of
medical professionals.


MUTUAL-HELP ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH AA


There are several organizations that, while based on mutual help, have no connections with AA's
programme and have a different background. These organizations originate either through professional
theory and leadership or social movements, such as temperance or the anti-alcohol movement.


In the USA, Rational Recovery Systems, an organization founded in California in 1986, claims to have
more than 350 groups internationally. Its goal is to help persons to recover from substance abuse and
dependence through self-reliance and self-help groups. The programme is non-religious and is based on
rational-emotive therapy. Some groups have professional advisers (The Self-Help Sourcebook, 1992).


In Europe there are several mutual-help organizations for alcohol or drug abusers that have a mainly
religious or social background. Among these is Kreuzbund, a German organization founded in 1896 on
the initiative of an abstainer whose brother was an alcoholic. By 1990 Kreuzbund had some 10,000
members in 1100 groups (including family and support members). It is rooted in the 19th century
temperance movement as well as in other abstinence organizations such as Blaues Kreuz (Lutheran), Blaues
Band, Freundeskreise and Guttempler. Kreuzbund is the largest group and is non-political and nonreligious, although from the very beginning it has received financial support from the Catholic Church.


These associations collaborate in action to influence the publics opinion of alcohol and drug issues. Until

1960 Kreuzbund also included members who were not alcohol-dependent, but since 1960 it has been


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 154


devoted only to alcohol-dependent persons. Family and support members are accepted in some activities
if they agree to maintain sobriety. The organization has developed rapidly in recent years and it has its own
rehabilitation programme based on personal change by group therapy.


Kreuzbundcalls its programme "Guidance Work to Self-Help". The organization aims to give the alcohol
dependent both a new orientation and a new social network without alcohol. The groups are organized
according to geographic area and three group meetings are held every week with the participation of family
members. Moral issues and family problems are the main subjects of these meetings (Kurube, 1992b ).


Another European mutual-help organization is the French La Croix d'Or, founded in 1919 on the initiative
of the Catholic anti-alcohol movement Croix Blanche. In 1990 La Croix d'Or had 30 000 members,
including alcohol dependents and support members. Like Kreuzbund, this organization is involved not only
in the recovery of members but also in issues of social change.


La Croix D'Or's motto is "Honour, Health and Happiness". There are four requirements for members: to
have the desire to stop the abuse, to admit the need for help, to help other alcohol dependents and to avoid
taking the first drink. Its ideology stresses the hope that every alcohol dependent person can achieve
happiness as a consequence of total abstinence. Another important goal is the promotion of public
awareness of prevention and treatment of alcoholism through campaigns and educational programmes
(Kurube, 1992b).


Along with La Croix d'Or, there are other international groups, such as La Croix Bleue, a Protestant
organization founded in Switzerland at the end of the 19th century, and Vie Lib re, a more recent lay
organization. In France, there are also several associations for former alcohol dependents that were created
without a religious background. Many have a corporate basis, such as Joie et Sante or Amities, which are
associated with large companies such as the railway and airlines systems or the electricity and gas
companies (Mosse, 1992).


The Rotterdam Junkiebond was one of the first Dutch Drug User Self-Organizations (DUSOs). Founded
in the early 1980s, its members are heroin users who, along with other DUSOs, were in the forefront of
prevention prior to the AIDS epidemic. Junkiebond was the first organization to establish a needle
distribution programme for preventing the spread of hepatitis B. The group also actively cooperates with
research groups.


DUSOs emerged in the Netherlands with direct government support. Churches, professionals and the mass
media encourage these organizations. The Amsterdam Medical Service for Heroin Users (MDHG), founded
in 1975, is another DUSO that is extremely active in local and national policy developments.


A National Federation of Junkiebonds is based in Lelystad. In a number of other countries, related activities
have also been growing. In Germany and Switzerland Junkie Unions and other self-organized groups are
flourishing. In Australia a number of anti-AIDS self-help organizations for drug users can be found. In
Europe and the USA, DUSOs are gaining wider recognition as preventive tools. Several New York projects
have demonstrated that DUSOs can be effective. DUSOs are specific mechanisms for stimulating
communities and their patient populations towards a greater responsibility for their own health.


Among active drug users, ex-users and allied organizations there are different specific interests. Thus there
are street-oriented Junkiebonds, policy-oriented Junkiebonds, issue-oriented organizations of ex-users and
others, political organizations run by non-user community organizers with the participation of users, and
agency-run or programme-run projects to put ex-users on the streets to conduct education. In addition,


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 155


Dutch Junkiebond prevention literature (e.g. the Rotterdam pamphlet Junky's Blood) is widely distributed
(Kaplan, 1992).


TREATMENT RESOURCES THAT INCLUDE A MUTUAL-HELP
COMPONENT


Some treatment resources for alcohol and drug abuse combine professional intervention with mutual help.
In some cases this approach is inspired by the AA philosophy, while in others by a different set of
principles.

During the late 1940s, some years before the emergence of the frrst AA groups in many countries, self-help
groups were used by medical professionals as part of their treatment and for aftercare. This was customary
in European countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and the former Yugoslavia
(Swiatkiewicz, 1992).


The development of self-help activities was interrupted in Poland in the 1950s and 1960s because of
political restrictions on non-state activities and prevalent moralistic perceptions of alcoholism. A climate
of anti-alcohol attitudes was promoted by the state propaganda and the promulgation of laws that provided
for compulsory treatment of alcohol-dependent persons.


During the 1970s, the patients' clubs renewed their development. These Polish clubs were influenced by
community psychiatry and by the experience of the self-help clubs for alcohol dependents in former
Yugoslavia founded by Dr Hudolin (Lang & Srdar, 1992). The clubs were established in local communities
and collaborated with the local commissions for mental health protection in preventive and rehabilitative
projects. As a result of the social and political changes in Poland after 1980, the alcohol treatment services
were re-examined and new opportunities for the development of self-help organizations were offered.


The first Polish Abstainers' Club was founded in 1960 by several alcohol dependents. In 1989, the
Federation of Abstainers' Clubs was established, comprising 200 clubs with some 40 000 members,
including family members. The federation receives fmancial support from the health system. The AA
groups came more prevalent in the early 1980s and they have received fmancial help from the government.
The clubs are active in prevention activities and they include family members.


Although the Polish Abstainers' Clubs consider their rehabilitation programme as equivalent to that of AA,
there are some basic differences. Abstainers' Clubs, called "The Way to Sobriety I, II", is based more on
psychosocial and practical principles than the programme of AA. Both movements are equally important
nowadays in Poland, and many Abstainers' Club members simultaneously attend AA meeting. Cooperation
between the two groups is, however, sometimes problematic due to ideological and practical issues. The
future of the two movements is uncertain due to the ongoing shortage of official funds (Swiatkiewicz, 1992~
Kurube, 1992b ).


In former Yugoslavia there was a nationwide network of several hundred "clubs" initiated by a psychiatrist,
Hudolin, and designed to carry out aftercare for alcohol dependent patients. According to Galanter (1990),
the ideology of the programme was closely aligned with the country's political orientation at the time he
made his observations. The system operated in collaboration with physicians and recovering patients,
leading to an apparent enhanced social cohesion and commitment to common ideals, such as the acceptance
of the goal of abstinence.

In former Czechoslovakia in the mid-1940s, Dr Skala and Dr J anda were working with alcoholics using a
biological therapy (emetine). They realized that it was necessary to work more intensively and longer with
patients to avoid relapses. Their work gave birth to the sociotherapeutic club TROTTING (Czech abbreviation for "Clubs of those Striving for Sobriety") at the Apolinar clinic. The club was inspired by AA but
acquired its own specific feature, and has been meeting regularly since 1948. The psychiatrists did not want
to leave the patients by themselves, preventing "the dangers sometimes encountered in AA, of group
disintegration or misleading by psychopathic personalities" (conversation with J. Skala, 1986). Besides,
the unified system of health care in the former Czechoslovakia required a medical worker to be in charge
of such a group. Cooperation between patients, ex-patients and therapists developed in these club meetings
on the premises of the alcohol dependency treatment centre. Dr Skala pointed out that the model has many
elements of the therapeutic community and also of behaviour therapy. With the recent sociopolitical
changes in the country, the current status of this treatment resource is not known.


Relationship between 12-steps Programmes and Professional Treatment.


The relationship between self-help organizations based on the 12 steps of _AA!NA_ and those based on
professional treatment may vary considerably in different countries. In some societies, most professionals
(psychiatrists and psychologists) view alcohol and drug problems as a symptom of an underlying mental
disturbance. Others accept the disease concept but have been trained to use various pharmacological or
psychotherapeutic techniques to treat these problems and they may have limited faith in lay activities. The
"spiritual" dimension of the 12-steps programme may not be accepted by many of these professionals.
There may, of course, be some feelings of rivalry. Followers of the 12-step programme in some societies
may show ambivalent attitudes to professionals. While they view professionals as having prestige and
power, many AA/NA members may distrust them because of bad experiences in the past and may feel that
professionals do not understand their problem. Some claim they have been incorrectly treated by
professionals, when prescribed medicines that possibly worsened their dependence.


In many cases, of course, professionals take 12-step organizations into account as part of the treatment for
dependence. In many hospitals, mental health centres or prisons where there are professional programmes
for the treatment of alcohol and/or drug problems, AA/NA groups have easy access and frequently hold
meetings on the premises. These "institutional groups" often complement the psychiatric or psychological
treatment of the patients. Many professionals frequently refer patients to _AA!NA_ groups and work in close
collaboration with them. In still other cases, the 12-step programme is an integral part of professional
treatment regimes and recovering alcohol or drug dependents are part of the institution's professional staff.


In some countries, especially the USA, there are many of these institutional 12-step treatment programmes.
The first attempts to apply the 12-step programme to professional treatment took place in the early 1950s.
However, it was during the 1970s and 1980s that this combination became a dominant feature of
professional treatment in North America (Makela, 1992). In these institutional centres the 12-steps belief
is combined with more scientific theories of dependence. The meetings at these centres differ from regular
_AAINA_ meetings. At the institutional meeting, each patient is pressured to speak, there is confrontation
to break denial, and counsellors tend to hand out causal explanations and psychological interpretations of
patients' behaviour (Cook, 1988a). The disease concept, which in AA/NA is a metaphor for the
powerlessness of human beings, becomes at the professional centres a well-defmed scientific theory.
Treatment centres that use the 12-step programme may be part of a mandatory treatment system in some
countries. This may result in many new members being poorly motivated, which contrasts with the AA/NA
principle of voluntary participation. At the professional12-step centres, sponsorship and the 12th-step
work are the responsibility of recovered patients who are paid as counsellors. Many members leaving such
centres and attending regular _AA!NA_ groups may have a different approach to the programme than the
traditional _AA!NA_ newcomers (Makela, 1992). One of the main treatment modalities combining the 12step programme with a professional and institutional approach is the Minnesota Model.

Minnesota Model


The origins of the Minnesota Model (MM) are in the founding in Minneapolis of three treatment centres
for alcohol dependence: Pioneer House, Hazelden and Willmar State Hospital (in 1948, 1949 and 1950
respectively). In the first two, non-professional recovered members of AA played an important role on the
creation and shaping of the programme format. In Willmar State Hospital, by 1950 the alcohol-dependent
patients were removed from the psychiatric wards and a new "inebriate treatment programme" was
introduced (Cook, 1988a).


Nowadays there are many MM treatment centres in the USA and other countries. However, it was not until
the 1970s that a marked growth was seen in the application of the MM approach in the USA, when state
and private insurances started to compensate for treatment of alcohol dependence. The number of private
for-profit specialized units for alcohol and drug problems grew from 199 in 1979 to 879 in 1987. In the
same period, the number of private nonprofit institutions, including many of the MM type, grew from 2736
to 3693 (Stenius, 1991).


Four key elements can be identified in the MM philosophy: the possibility to change beliefs, attitudes and
behaviours of alcohol and drug dependents; the "disease concept" as held by AA, NA and the American
Psychiatric Association; treatment goals of abstinence from all mood altering chemicals, improvement of
lifestyle and personal growth; and the principles of AA and NA, summarized in the 12-steps, including
spiritual awareness, recognition of choice and personal responsibility and the reconstruction of
relationships.


There is considerable uniformity in philosophy and practice between different MM facilities around the
world. A multidiscipliruuy approach, the AA programme and the involvement of recovered alcohol or drug
dependents as counsellors are the basis of the model. In its simplest form, the MM treatment involves
assessment and admission to a residential treatment facility (for 3-6 weeks in the USA or 6-8 weeks in the
United Kingdom) and the progression to a halfway house and aftercare that usually includes intensive
attendance at AA or NA. In its fuller form, MM comprises a range of facilities to meet the needs of
different groups, such as women and teenagers.


There are three levels of intervention practised by many MM centres: health promotion, prevention and
treatment. Depending on the type of service needed, there is a first phase where information, diagnosis or
referral are provided. The following step may consist of education, external care or detoxification and
medical care. This is followed by a primary residential treatment, extended rehabilitation (therapeutic
community for more than two months), residential intermediate care (halfway house), outpatient care and
aftercare (AA/NA meetings, counselling, individual/group therapy), and an intensive family programme.


The staff is multiprofessional and recovering alcohol and drug dependents play a central role. The
therapeutic milieu shares the common attributes of other therapeutic communities: an informal, communal
atmosphere; the group meeting having a central place in the therapeutic programme; sharing of work and
participatory management and decision-making by staff and residents; and the acceptance of certain basic
values and beliefs.


In countries where treatment of alcohol and drug dependence is paid for by public funds or by insurance
companies, the MM treatment has been very popular. However, with the economic crisis that has resulted
in restrictions on public expenditure, there are doubts about the long-term expansion or even survival of
many of these centres without state or medical insurance support. In countries where neither of these
resources have been available, such as Mexico, the MM treatment centres are private institutions that treat
only clients of upper socioeconomic levels.


WHO/PSN93. 10
page 158


Most studies on MM results have been criticized on methodological grounds, but the published figures
show that as many as two-thirds of admissions apparently achieved a genuinely good outcome at one year
follow-up. The success of the MM treatment approach seems to be related to the value of a
"comprehensive" ()r "multiprofessional" approach to the management of dependence. In particular, the role
played by counsellors who are themselves former alcohol or drug dependents is valuable in a therapeutic
community approach that utilizes group therapy, the sharing of life histories and supervised peer evaluation
(Cook, 1988b). Another important aspect of the MM approach is an examination of the rationale behind
every action of the patient.


Therapeutic communities


Therapeutic communities (TCs) dealing with drug problems began in the USA with the foundation of
Synanon in the late 1950s in California. The origins of this approach to recovery go back to ancient Greek
civilization which strove to provide citizens with a community whose structure, support and challenges
allowed individuals to be a part of something greater than themselves, thereby enabling them to expand
their sense of personal meaning. An early Christian mystical sect is reported to have practised rituals of
public confession (Glaser, 1981; Heit, 1991).


In this century, the Oxford groups movement has included similar practices in its meetings. Maxwell Jones
and colleagues have incorporated these ideas into their work in mental institutions, using a democratic
therapeutic group process with the patients.


While it is acknowledged in the United Kingdom that the psychiatric therapeutic community have influenced
the treatment methods of TCs, no such influence has affected the initial development of TCs in the USA.
Alcoholics Anonymous is the immediate antecedent of Synanon and the other early American TCs. Both
these TC models have an existential view of recovery and employ the self-help group process to achieve
it (Rosenthal, 1989). The theory underlying this approach is based on the view of narcotic dependence as
symptomatic of an underlying character disorder. This defect results from inadequate socialization, and the
individual typically reacts to stress by the use of drugs.


There is an important conceptual difference between treatment resources practising the 12-steps philosophy
and those employing the traditional TC model. For the 12-step programme, dependence is a "primary
disease", a mental, physical and spiritual illness. The TC approach, however, views dependence as
secondary to personal and social problems.


Synanon


In 1957, Charles Dederich, the founder of Synanon, was deeply involved in AA in California, devoting
much of his time to helping alcohol dependents and working and living in a 12-steps house. However, he
was strongly influenced by Emerson's _Self-Reliance_ and began to distance himself from AA meetings
because of "the religious overtones of the meetings and the lack of the utilization of thoughts of
anthropology, psychology, philosophy and sociology". He began to hold meetings with other alcohol
dependents in his own apartment and started to experiment with different forms of group therapy. This
evolved into a more directive type of discussion with strong cross-examination under his leadership and
control. This approach gradually developed into the Synanon method (Room & Miikela, 1993).


By 1958, the first drug dependents had started to come to Dederich's meetings, which were soon moved to
an empty store that became a clubhouse. Many of the dependents began to drift away, feeling that the
newly-established Synanon Foundation was moving further and further away from AA principles.


WHOIPSA/93.10

page 159


At the beginning, Dederich tried to develop a residential programme for both drug and alcohol dependents.
Eventually· it focused on drug abusers, especially heroin dependents. The initial aim of the Synanon
programme was to rehabilitate the dependent and discharge him after a two-year period. Unfortunately, by
the rnid~1960s, it had become clear that many of Synanon's graduates were drifting back into drug use. As
a result, Synanon's leaders concluded that society at large was a dangerous and pathological milieu.
Thereafter, they promised the dependent person a rewarding life free of drugs only as long as he remained
part of the Synanon organization (Antze, 1976; Glaser, 1971).


Synanon thus became a way of life in itself rather than a means of re-entering society at large. The policy
on funding was to avoid the use of public resources. It was felt that public funds would inevitably mean
public control, so Synanon charged an admission fee.


Synanon's ideology is practised through two separate fields of action: "The Floor" and "The Game". The
Floor refers to everyday life among members, with its rigid and detailed set of standards for attitudes and
behaviour. The Game is the heart of Synanon's programme, a daily exercise lasting three or four hours and
involving some 12 players seated in circle. Short of physical violence, players may say or do anything they
wished. It consists, in practice, of a series of "indictments" directed against each player until he/she
"breaks" either by crying or by exploding in anger. The Game allows individuals to express and share fears,
resentments and misdeeds with the group. It represents a device for purging feelings and for generating a
cathartic experience on a routine basis. It has become, over time, a learning experience and a form of
cognitive conditioning. It serves as a way to teach the origin of interpersonal tensions and the constructive
development of emotional bonds along with feeling of new closeness with fellow players.


However, Synanon became a violent cult responding to Dederich's every whim. The latest incarnation of
Synanon is the De Lancey Street Foundation in San Francisco, a self-help residential education centre for
former substance abusers and ex-convicts (Hurvitz, 1976).


In the meantime, the TC movement took root, adopting many of Synanon's original methods. The first
American TCs shared three common elements: there were no staff, there were no licences or standards to
be met, and there was no funding or other fmancial concerns (Heit, 1991 ). These early TCs evolved almost
independently of medical and psychiatric mainstreams. The fact that they were outsiders gave them the
freedom to discover innovative methods. It allowed them to form communities that provided long-term
personal involvement with residents in an environment that promoted learning, change and spiritual growth.


Today there are few TCs that still have these early attributes since most are now professional organizations.
They have a large number of staff and all the legal, bureaucratic and resource development machinery that
this involves. They have many standards for individual credentialing and several levels of regulatory
oversight. There is also more concern and funding.


As many as 500 second and third generation TCs had appeared in the USA by 1982, founded by former
TC residents and employing variations of the treatment approach. Programmes such as Daytop Village,
Gateway Foundation, Samaritan Village and Phoenix House do generally conform to the traditional TC
approach, although they have substantially modified many original TC practices.


**The** basic TC **model**


The therapeutic community considers substance abuse a disorder of the whole person affecting some or all
areas of :functioning. Cognitive and behavioural problems appear, as do mood disturbances; thinking may
be unrealistic or disorganized and values are confused, antisocial or nonexistent. In the TC's view of
recovery, the aim of rehabilitation is global. The primary psychological goal is to change the negative


WHO/PSN93.l0
page 160


patterns of behaviour, thinking and feeling that predispose to drug use. The main social goal is to develop
a responsible drug-free lifestyle (Glaser, 1971; Therapeutic Communities of America, 1993).


Individuals admitted to TCs encounter a highly structured environment which stresses honesty, trust and
self-help. In addition to daily group counselling, seminars and individual activities, all clients are assigned
house responsibilities. These chores serve to teach the residents basic cooperation, responsibility, respect
and discipline.


Among the elements that serve as common threads in TCs today are a structured hierarchy, or a programme
that sets firm and consistent limits; a reward system with increased privileges and responsibilities as people
begin to control their behaviour, a social learning and role-modeling process with positive peer pressure,
the development and maintenance of positive values, stressing the benefits of a drug-free and non-violent
life and the healing power of the community where the TC forms a loving family (Rosenthal, 1991).


Structurally, the TC model is a 24 hour-a-day residential programme with a primary treatment staff most
often composed of trained ex-abusers. Although traditional programmes usually consider the optimal
length of treatment to be at least 15 months, this is no longer practised by most TCs. Some programmes
may involve residential care for a few weeks, followed by a year or more of outpatient treatment.
Nevertheless, long-term residential care seems to be more successful in helping drug users.


Clients enter the TC voluntarily, although this decision is generally made under some form of pressure from
families, employers or the law. Factors such as communal nurturing, empathic understanding, control of
personal behaviour, self-disclosure and a shared common code of conduct and belief system are apparent
keys to their success (Rosenthal, 1989).


The TC model can be found in its standard and other versions. There are, for instance, TCs with a strong
medical influence where the intervention includes detoxification and the use of antabuse or methadone.
Psychiatric and psychological evaluations are important in this type of programme, although a variety of
therapeutic group processes provide the major treatment intervention (Spiegel & Sells, 1974). Although
medical and social service professionals play an important role in these TCs, former drug dependents are
still used as counsellors and group leaders. The residential phase of recovery is shorter than in other nonmedical TCs, as they offer an outpatient support programme.


There are other TCs in which chemicals are used only during detoxification. Their programme is similar
to that of standard TCs but they differ in that there is no emphasis on a hierarchical structure and the
guiding philosophy implies belief in positive reinforcement rather than in punitive measures. However,
discipline is strict and residents have many prescribed activities. Staff may include mental health
professionals as well as recovered drug dependents.


Due to the illegal nature of many drug-related activities rehabilitation of convicted drug abusers is an
important application of the TC model. There are programmes for criminals on probation and also for
inmates within the jails.


Most TCs include a family programme and many also have special programmes for women, adolescents,
HIV -positive persons or other special population groups. Many TCs offer training programmes in
counselling, vocational guidance, education and work and some are involved in community prevention
programmes.


Other countries have adopted the American TC model with some variations. There are many TCs for drug
problems in non-anglophone countries such as Italy and Brazil. A French TC known as **The Patriarch** was


WHO/PSA/93 .1 0

created in 1972 and currently has centres in many countries where young drug dependents are expected to
stay an average of three years.


COMMENTS


Mutual-help groups for alcohol and drug abusers have been in existence for several decades. Recently
researchers and health professionals have shown a growing interest in the mutual-help phenomenon. There
are several important reasons for understanding these self-help organizations better: the increase in alcohol
and drug abuse in many societies; the growth, diversification and impact of the mutual-help phenomenon;
and the need to fmd more effective available resources for recovery. The increasing cost of public health
services and the limitation of funds have also promoted interest in self-help activities. There is a trend
towards increasing the responsibility of health care in small communities and individuals.


Mutual-help groups may be seen as social inventions practising a kind of psychotherapy that, in most cases,
has its origins in a religious tradition and secular democratic philosophy.


Self-help movements such as AA, are viewed by Room (1993) as an essentially modern phenomenon, both
in ideology and practice. On the one hand, AA attacks individualism at the same time it stresses the
importance of individual will, thought and action. In the context of developed societies, AA can be seen
as a corrective to the culture of individualism or egoistic pride, while in other societies it may actually
further the introduction of individual thought and action.


Mutual-help groups have often played an important role in determining policies concerning problems of
alcohol and drugs. The current popularity of literature inspired by the 12 steps is one indication of the
impact of these beliefs around the world.


In terms of health policies on the treatment of alcohol and drug dependence, self-help groups should not
exclude the responsibility for providing health care services. Unfortunately, there is always the danger that
this approach may be used simply because it does not cost anything and not because they may be effective.


Professionals have long been involved with self-help groups and are valuable because of their resources and
technical advice so they should not be excluded. However, there are various potential dangers with this
collabomtion. Professionals may try to control the self-help activities instead of understanding the group's
philosophy and dynamics. Another danger is that one may try to formalize or institutionalize these groups,
which could mean their destruction.


The adoption of self-help in professional settings has many advantages but it is not a resource available in
many regions, due to cost and prevalent attitudes among professionals. In many countries, non-residential
self-help groups may be the only lasting resource for the recovery of alcohol and drug dependent persons.
Nevertheless, professional involvement is important, especially in cases of dual diagnosis. People with
psychiatric disorders in addition to dependence may face many problems when attending only nonresidential self-help groups. In many cases, the group may discourage the search for professional help,
believing that its programme is sufficient to deal with the problem and that the disorder can be controlled
as recovery progresses. In cases of serious mental illness this can be very dangerous. Psychiatric disorders
are more prevalent among alcohol and drug abusers than among the general population and many
psychiatric patients are chemically dependent.


An advantage of mutual-help groups is that they offer their members a life-long network of peer support
to help avoid relapses and improve their lives. This cannot be provided by professional treatment. Not all


WHO/PSN93.10
page 162


dependent persons can join such groups, often because the mutual-help phenomenon is not yet as diverse
as in the USA. Consequently, people who have difficulty with the spiritual aspect of the 12-step
programme may face difficulties if there are no other mutual-help groups available.


Nowadays self-help groups are an important feature of society and the treatment milieu. There is every
reason to believe that the phenomenon of mutual-help groups for alcohol and drug dependents will continue
to grow, due mostly to their capacity to adapt to different societies and different cultures.

VIII. THE ROLE OF TRADITIONAL HEALING
IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SUBSTANCE

ABUSE


DEFINITION AND DELIMITATION


The tenn "traditional healing" as used here refers to non-orthodox therapeutic practices based on indigenous
cultural traditions which operate outside official health care systems. Although often validated by
experience, these practices are not founded on a positivist system oflogico-experimental science.


"Alternative therapies" which are demonstrably offshoots of W estem school medicine, or are idiosyncratic
interpretations or appositional variations thereof (e.g., homoeopathy, naturopathy, etc.) are not included
here as they do not fulfil the definition of traditional healing. Acupuncture, although derived from Chinese
traditional medicine, is now practised on a global scale and used in the treatment of substance abuse, and
therefore will not be included either.


What is included in the present chapter are therapeutic ventures based on Islamic, Buddhist and Hinduist
religious traditions, syncretistic amalgamations of traditional non-Western indigenous practices with
Christian faith healing, and Western-inspired mutual aid groups that have been reinterpreted and repattemed
according to non-Western cultural traditions making them essentially different culture-specific approaches.


CONCEPTS OF TRADITIONAL HEALING


Some important general concepts of traditional and folk healing can be extracted from the above approaches
to substance abuse. The following are operational in many traditonal practices and of relevance to the
therapeutic and preventive management of substance abuse.


Suggestive and symbolic ritual


Traditional therapy is usually conducted in the context of a ceremony composed of several ritual-symbolic
procedures involving the use of culturally validated sacred or arcane symbols by traditional practioners.
These include incantations and invocations, recitations of story, parable and simile, as well as skillful
manipulation of images and objects. The audience often participate in the therapeutic ceremonies along
with the clients. Implicit and explicit suggestion based on collective beliefs is operant in the ritual-symbolic
procedures of treatment and prevention and serves the therapeutic goal. The effects of suggestion are
intensified through the relatively common utilization of altered states of consciousness in traditional
therapies.


Purification


Various procedures are followed as purifying measures to eliminate the addictive and "polluting"
substances, some going so far as to be a general cleansing of body and mind. The cleansing is brought


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 168


about by herbal emetics and laxatives, intake of holy or healthy fluids, ablutions, washings, dousings, sweat
baths, steam baths, fumigation with incense or smoke, brushing with twigs and rubbing with oils. These
procedures have hydrotherapeutic, physiotherapeutic and suggestive-symbolic aspects.


Confession, pledge and sacrifice


The admission of harmful behaviour associated with substance use as a transgression against divine rules,
or as the neglect of obligations to kinspeople or community members, is combined with a solemn pledge
or sacred vow before the healer and audience. The patient promises to correct his or her behaviour and the
pledge is usually associated with the commitment to make a personal sacrifice for rehabilitation and/or
compensation. These actions, intended to appease and reconcile supernatural agencies and/or significant
others, have the marked effect of alleviating anxiety and relieving the patient's guilt. They may also lead
to re-acceptance by kin and community.


Catharsis


In a culture-congenial situation that facilitates psychodramatic abreaction, affective release may be achieved
through a catharsis triggered by adequate sensocy stimulation, or in an altered state of consciousness
induced by psychological, physiological or phytochemical means. Therapeutic effects are increased through
the experience of empathy shown by an understanding and accepting audience of kin and community
members.


GEOGRAPHICAL OVERVIEW


Buddhist treatment centres in Thailand


Detoxification and rehabilitation treatment for substance dependence is performed at five Buddhist
monasteries in Thailand. At four of these the focus is on opiate dependence although cannabis, solvent and
_kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)_ addicts are also admitted. At the fifth monastecy of Wat Ta Shee, the
majority of the clientele are alcoholics. The duration of obligatocy inpatient treatment is short, ranging from
a few days to a few weeks depending on the centre, but patients are invited to stay longer. Some actually
join the monastic community and become eo-therapists.


Each centre has its own procedures but common principles can be defmed. The treatment requires total
commitment; it utilizes the culture-congenial death and rebirth myth and the symbolism of religious
initiation. For example the patient can take a solemn public vow to abstain forever, or may participate in
a mock funeral of his former self to shed the vestiges of his evil addict personality.


In most centres mixtures of various herbal medicines (not identified) are orally administered in the initial
treatment phase, with the stated purpose of eliminating chemical and spiritual pollution. At Wat Tarn
Krabok the patient has to go through a nauseating ordeal in a group therapeutic setting reminiscent of
Pavlovian deconditioning, although the addictive drug is only spoken of and not taken. The herbal
medicine, said to consist of "1 00 plant ingredients", is administered daily for five days with copious


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 169


amounts of water. The mixture has a strong emetic effect which is intensified by the visual, auditory and
olfactory stimulus of collective retching and vomiting, accompanied by the loud rhythmic drumming of
already detoxified peers and by the exhortations of the monk-therapists. The herbal medicines used at W at
Pa Pang, Wat Tarn Talu and Wat Ta Shee induce a brief period of semi-comatose sleep or unconsciousness
followed by a delirium-like state which may counteract physical withdrawal symptoms. The effects of the
herbal treatment - physical exhaustion after prolonged vomiting and loss of consciousness - emphasize the
death-rebirth symbolism, suggesting to the patient the start of a new life.


This intensive and dramatic treatment is followed by a period of recuperation, assisted by physiotherapeutic
measures such as herbal steam baths. During the rest and recreation phase religious teaching and
therapeutic counselling is intensified. Although mainly conducted in groups, individual therapy is available,
with rehabilitated addicts playing an important role in both. There is also the opportunity for musical and
other entertainment. At some centres it is possible to help in temple and facility construction or religious
artwork as a kind of voluntary ergotherapy. The treatment is free, Thai temple communities relying on
donations from the pious. The substistence contribution is minimal and may be waived. Maintaining
contact with family is encouraged and family members are accommodated in some centres.


Extent of utilization: On the basis of previously published figures it has been estimated that the number
of patients treated at Wat Tarn Krabok since 1960 runs to the tens of thousands, and several thousand
others must have been treated at the other centres that started in the 1970s.


Acceptability: Patients come from Thailand and other countries of South and South-East Asia. A few
Westerners can always be found among clientele and monk-therapists. In spite of the initial treatment
ordeal, the clients' dignity is always safeguarded and there is no stigma attached to having been a drug
addict since many of the therapists share the same experience. The larger community participates in
funding through donation, sponsorship and volunteer activity. The work of the Buddhist treatment centres
is recognised by government authorities such as the Narcotics Control Board, which has led to some grant
support. The centres have had positive publicity in national and international media, particularly Wat Tarn
Krabok. The attitude of the official health care system appears favourable and Thai experts on drug
addiction treatment remain open-minded towards this approach.


Efficacy: Enquiries on long-term results are made by the centres and results are stated in round figures
such as "70% success, 25% relapse" without specifying time limits. Scientific follow-up studies conducted
in the late 1970s by the Drug Dependence Research Centre, Institute of Health Research, at Chulalongkom
University, indicated that the rate of success as measured in six-months post-discharge abstinence rates was
not inferior to that achieved by modem drug dependence treatment in medical institutions (Posh)'achina

1980, 1982, 1985). Westermeyer reached a similar conclusion (1979, 1980) in 1972/73 while observing
treatment outcome in Laotian narcotic addicts treated at W at T am Krabok. He compared results with those
attained in an official drug treatment programme in Laos. In terms of public cost-effectiveness the Buddhist
centres are admittedly far superior to official treatment programmes. In terms of safety for the patient there
may be some concern regarding the possible toxic effects of the unknown herbal agents which induce emesis
that can result in collapse or impairment/loss of consciousness. A higher mortality rate than in medical
facilities was reported among aged opium addicts in the past but the number of admissions of such patients


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 170


has been steadily decreasing. (Jilek, unpubl.notes; Jilek-Aall & Jilek, 1985; Poshyachinda, 1980, 1982,
1985; Tarn Krabok Monastery, date undertermined; Westermeyer, 1979, 1980.)


Traditional healing in Laos


Opium addicts are treated by Buddhist monks in religious and quasi-religious settings, often after taking
a solemn vow to abstain. Withdrawal symptoms are treated by massage, induced sweating, special diet and
herbal remedies, some of which have sedative effects. Addicts may stay at a temple for individually
determined periods, to receive counselling and participate in religious ceremonies. Doctors specializing in
herbal treatments who operate outside religious settings also treat opium addicts and may add decreasing
doses of opium or alcohol to the herbal remedies they administer during the withdrawal period. Massage,
acupuncture and other techniques are also used.


Acceptability: Due to the traditional therapeutic role and high prestige of the Buddhist clergy, treatment
in religious settings is very well accepted by the community and by motivated addicts. Government attitude
toward the Buddhist clergy is tolerant and sympathetic in general, extending to their healing activities as
well. (Sources: Jilek, unpubl.notes; Westermeyer 1973, 1982).


Hmong Shamanic rituals integrated in modern treatment programmes


Shamanic rituals, traditionally used in Laotian Hmong villages to free opium addicts from their dependence,
have been integrated into a modem opium detoxification and rehabilitation programme for drug addicts in
a hill-tribes refugee camp in northern Thailand by the International Rescue Committee, in consultation with
the author.


Hmong Shamans iniate new patient groups through a ceremony meant to entice the opium goddess to leave
the addicts for a new residence in a miniature palace built and symbolically provisioned for her needs.
Addicts surrender opium smoking utensils and choice specimens are put in the miniature palace. The
addicts take a sacred vow in front of the palace to never use drugs again, while the senior shaman invokes
supernatural powers for confirmation.


The patient group is exorcised, united by a rope tied to a sacrifed pig which serves as spirit messenger. The
officiating shaman symbolically travels to the other world to free the addicts' souls from their captivity in
the power of the opium spirits. Finally the new abode of the opium goddess and the surrendered opium
utensils are burnt in a big bonfire. As the smoke rises, it is declared that the opium goddess has definitely
left the addicts and returned to the other world with the opium items. The ceremonial is concluded by a
communal meal shared by patients, shamans and staff. Throughout the three remaining weeks of inpatient
treatment the shamans continue to render spiritual support to clientele of the International Rescue
Committee detoxification centre.


Acceptability: Although participation in the shamanic rituals is absolutely voluntary, most patients do take
part. The ceremonial appeals to the great majority of hill-tribes refugees of various ethnic groups more than
the unadapted medical programmes or those with Christian religious influences. However, even christian


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 171


hill-tribe patients participate in the ceremony. Catholic religious functionaries have been both tolerant and
supportive.


Efficacy: The main effectiveness of this shamanic input is in motivating hill-tribe addicts to remain
compliant and cooperative within the modern therapeutic programme. In marked contrast to the previous
experience of having many patients drop out while under treatment, the new programme with shamanic
input achieved unexpectedly high treatment course completion rates of 80% to 90% and a significantly
increased half-year abstinence rate of around 70% in 1988/89 (Jilek, unpubl.notes & videos; Jilek, 1990).


Traditional treatment in Malaysia


Traditional treatment of substance dependence (mostly opiate addiction, but also alcohol abuse) is
performed by Malay traditionaltherapists, Chinese-Taoist practitioners and Hinduist-Ayurvedic healers.
In spite of the religious orientation of these practitioners, the clientele is not limited to co-religionists.
Adaptations of ritual procedures may be made in a remarkably tolerant manner to accommodate patients
of other religious persuasion. In recent years treatment centres based on Malay-Islamic and on ChineseTaoist traditions that specialize in the detoxification and rehabilitation of substance dependent patients have
become operational. These centres treat groups of clients in inpatient programmes of one to several weeks'
duration that are more standardized than the widely varying approaches of practitioners who operate
individually.


Acceptability: Traditional treatment approaches to substance dependence appear well accepted by
motivated addicts and by the community in Malaysia; Government Health authorities hold a generally
supportive attitude towards them. Surveys have shown that traditional resources are extensively used for
the management of substance abuse problems and are often turned to first (Sources: Heggenhougen, 1984;

Heggenhoug~ & Navaratnam, 1979; Jilek, unpubl.notes; Johnson, 1983; Lee, 1985; McGovern, 1982;
Spencer, Heggenhougen & Navaratnam, 1980; Teo Hui Khian, 1983; Werner, 1979).


Treatment based on Malay Islamic traditions


In spite of the considerable variety of procedures available, most treatments based on Malay Islamic
traditions follbw the general principle of initial internal purgation and external cleaning from chemical and
spiritual pollution, combined with the sedative alleviation of withdrawal symptoms and followed by
spiritual-didactic counselling. Internal purgation of the drug-poison is the proclaimed purpose of inducing
emesis and/or diuresis and bowel movements through herbal medicine, salt water and pushing fluids. Water
treated by religious and magical ritual, e.g., mixed with the ashes of holy scriptures, is often used. External
cleaning is part of an exorcistic ritual of highly suggestive symbolism intended to release the addict from
drug-bondage which is commonly viewed as evil spirit possession or the effect of black magic wrought by
drug manufacturers or dealers.


As a result of such exorcistic procedures the addict feels released from the burden of guilt and therefore free
to resume a healthy lifestyle under the guidance of spiritual-religious counselling. The techniques employed
include body writing with Islamic verse, magic or Hindu symbols according to the client's religion; rubbing
with ashes of sacred items; face washing and cooling baths in water which has either been blessed and


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 172


scented with roses or other flowers, or in water with lemon or lime juice added. The latter has physiologic
as well as psychologic effects and usually terminates the intensive treatment phase.


Religious-magical formulae accompany the ritual acts. The patient may enter an altered state of
consciousness by repetitious chanting of the divine appelation and thereby become especially receptive to
preventive didactic counselling. A sacred oath or other religiously buttressed commitment concludes the
treatment, encouraging the client to abstain from taking substances, to embrace a healthy lifestyle and to
avoid the company of drug users. Clients are frequently fortified against relapse through protective charms
or talismans.


The following are among the herbal remedies administered as medicinal teas: (with antiphlogistic action)
_Limacea oblongata, Erythrina subumbrans, Gomphandra;_ (with diuretic _action)Moringa olifera,_ leaves
of white hibiscus; (with purgative action) _Cassia alata;_ (with sedative action) _Mimosa pudica, Acanthus_
_ebracteatus;_ (with tonic action) _Aquilaria malaccensis;_ (with antispasmodic-anticolic action) Mesua
ferrea, _Randia, Turmeric, Zingiber officina/e._


Efficacy: Experimental pharmacological studies at the Universiti Sains Malaysia have shown that certain
herbal medicines administered in traditional treatment of opiate addicts have the effect of suppressing
withdrawal symptoms in mice and a similar effect in humans appears likely. One follow-up investigation
of addicts treated by Malay traditional methods was conducted under strict scientific criteria (rating nontraceable patients as therapy failures) and found one-year post-therapy abstinence rates ranging from 8%
to 35% in the total clientele of five different healers (Spencer et al., 1980).


Chinese medicine and Taoist traditions


Chinese practitioners use heital remedies according to yin-yang.principles and magical rituals founded in
Taoist tradition in Malaysia. The intended objectives and some of the methods used in traditional Chinese
drug dependence treatment are similar to those employed in Malay Islamic therapy. Sometimes there is
initial purgation of the body from the drug-poison by inducing vomiting, diuresis and defecation. There is
always sedation and often sleep-induction by herbal medicines. This is followed by baths, usually in
flavoured or spiced rainwater which is often magically treated to counteract the addiction-provoking
supernatural forces generally assumed to have been instilled in the drugs by the manufacturers.


Chinese herbal remedies, such as the "anti-opium leaf" _Combretium sundaicum,_ have traditionally been
used to alleviate withdrawal symptoms in opium addicts (McBride, 1910). Today the main traditionderived therapy of drug addiction among Chinese populations anywhere consists of acupuncture, often
combined with physiotherapy, especially acupressure massage, and sometimes also with the administration
of herbal remedies. Extracts of mixed herbs such as qiang huo, gou teng, chuan xi on, fu zi and yan hu suo
are commonly used, and seemed to have a suppressive effect on the morphine withdrawal syndrome in
addicted laboratory rats in experiments conducted at the University of Hong Kong (Yang & Kwok, 1986).
Encouraged by the example of Chinese traditional medicine, administration of herbal tea blends and other
plant remedies and nutrients is today incorporated in many drug treatment programmes of the industrialized
world and is said to be highly beneficial (Nebelkopf, 1987).


WHO/PSA/93.10

Treatments derived from Hinduist traditions


Hindu healers often go into a trance to contact spirits and divine entities and to perform ritual acts of
symbolic connotation.


Ayurveda


In the treatment of substance dependence, herbal remedies are prescribed to counteract withdrawal
symptoms and provide relaxation, usually in combination with soothing lime or lemon water baths, in
accordance with the rules of Ayurvedic medicine. Ayurvedic medicine is considered an official, indigenous
health care system in India and Nepal. Drug dependence treatment based on Ayurvedic and other Hinduist
traditions enjoys the same government support in Malaysia as do treatments based on Islamic or Chinese
traditions. Acceptance and cross-utilization of traditional therapies by adherents of other religions is
common in Malaysia and the Indian subcontinent.


There is reference in the classical texts of A yurveda to a precursor of the severe mental disorder which is
brought on by alcohol abuse but a specific treatment is not mentioned. Somatic consequences of chronic
alcohol abuse such as gastro-intestinal and hepatic complications were described by C'araka (1st century
AD) who recommended herbal remedies with thirst-reducing, appetite-enhancing, generally roborant,
digestion-stimulating, muscle-relaxing and tranquilizing properties. These are still used today in the
Ayurvedic treatment of alcohol abuse and are administered orally in the form of an asavam, a weak (1-2%)
alcoholic preparation of mixed herbal remedies obtained by fermentation of an aqueous solution with added
sugar-containing nutrients.


Scientific evaluation: "SKV", an Ayurvedic formula employed to curb alcohol abuse, is a fermentation
of cane sugar, raisins and a solution of 12 identified herbal ingredients. The University of Madras tested
it for effectiveness in controlling ethanol addiction and reversing ethanol-induced pathological changes in
rats (Shanmugasundaram et al., 1986a, l986b) and observed a marked reduction in ethanol intake,
attributed to a constraint on the craving for alcohol. Other findings included an increase in food intake,
reversal of ethanol-induced ECG and EEG abnormalities, and reduction of the elevated gamma-GT values
indicative of alcoholic liver damage. The hepatic and cerebral lesions seen in ethanol-addicted rats were
not apparent in alcoholic rats treated by "SKV", which also had no adverse effect on the test animals.


In Malaysia, Hinduist-derived therapies focusing on the treatment of drug addictions appear to be more
common than in India and have been well documented in the above-cited literature.


Yoga


Yoga techniques are commonly employed for the physical and spiritual strengthening of the recovering
client during and after traditional detoxification. Yoga therapy has a crucial role in the rehabilitation of
drug dependent patients at the N av-Chetna Drug De-addiction and Rehabilitation Centre, V aranasi, India,
which provides a package of systematic yoga exercises in the pre-and post-detoxification phases (Sharma
& Shukla, 1988). The exercises relating to body postures, breathing and "purification" appear especially
suited to counteract withdrawal symptoms. A pre-detoxification yoga programme was developed which


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 174


reduced drug craving and engendered positive attitudinal changes so that addicts were motivated. In the
post-detoxification period, yoga furthered the process of physical recovery and psychosocial reintegration
(no statistics given).


Transcendental meditation


Transcendental meditation originated in ancient Vedic traditions of India but has in recent decades spread
around the globe. Western countries are using it more and more in the management and prevention of drug
dependence and therefore it has lost much of its traditional Hinduist connotation.


Transcendental meditation organizations and teachers are to be found in over 100 countries and in many
places special programmes have been designed to combat drug abuse (Clements et al., 1988). These
programmes operate largely outside the official health care system. The transcendental meditation
technique is said to be acquired by most adepts in four to five instructional sessions and then is practised
by the individual twice a day for periods of 15 to 20 minutes, without further supervision, counselling or
advice.


Transcendental meditation is offered as a programme for personal development and not as a specific
treatment of substance dependence. It may therefore be more acceptable to those young people who
basically condone drug use. It is claimed that alleviation of drug abuse occurs as an "automatic side effect"
in the context of overall personality development under transcendental meditation, irrespective of reasons
given for substance use or of the particular substance used.


Evaluation: One questionnaire study conducted in the USA in 1972 (Benson & Wallace, 1984) of 1862
young people, practising transcendental meditation, resulted in the majority of subjects who had been using
cannabis, hallucinogens, narcotics, amphetamines, barbiturates, and/or high-percentage alcohol prior to
starting the transcendental meditation programme showed a significant change in attitude. Proof lay in the
decrease in the amount of substance use, or the discontinuance of drug use, decrease or cessation of drug
traficking activity, and discouraging others from abusing drugs. A recent review of research studies states
that the transcendental meditation programme is associated with significant decreases in the use of a variety
of substances (Clements et al., 1988).


Altered states of consciousness


ln Hinduist rituals, worshippers of Lord Murugan undergo the piercing of their bodies with miniature spears
and with hooks to help them carry sacred objects or pull religious vehicles during the Hindu thaipusam
festival celebrated annually in Hindu communities of Malaysia, and to a lesser extent in South India. They
take sacred vows of total and ongoing abstinence from alcohol and drug use in continuation of the
obligatory period of fasting and abstinence prior to the celebrations. These vows are made in hope of some
act of divine mercy and carry supernatural sanction since they are associated with an intense experience of
ecstatic trance which affords the supplicant relative analgesia.

Therapeutic approaches based on Japanese buddhist traditions


Danshukai


While Alcoholics Anonymous in Japan, as in most of Asia, has only a limited appeal and mainly consists
of westernized persons and expatriates, the Danshukai Alcohol Abstinence Society, founded in 1958, has
been a notable success. By 1977 the society had 25,000 members attending meetings, the majority
abstinent for more than one year. Based on traditional Japanese values, Danshukai encourages positive
dependence and reliance on family members. It invites the active cooperation of spouses and children in
attending meetings, so the effort to overcome alcohol abuse is a family effort. Unlike AA, Danshukai is
not anonymous. Names and addresses of members are not confidential and outside persons, including nonalcoholics, are welcome to join meetings and talk freely in the group. It may be noted here that Danshukai
has these features in common with the culture-congenial North American Indian AA groups described
below. (Suwaki, 1979, 1980; Takemoto et al., 1979)


Naikan


N aikan "self-observation" therapy is derived from the mishirabe self-examination practice of Shinshu
Buddhism. It utilizes the self-disciplinary tendencies in Japanese culture and the repetitive ritual methods
of Zen training to achieve concentrated and critical self-observation. It focuses on solitary meditation of
a specific theme, namely the client's past and present relationship with a significant family member,
beginning with the mother, under the guidance of a therapist who poses relevant questions at regular
intervals but is not present all the time. Naikan aims at a critical self-assessment of the alcoholic's past
conduct, the recognition of dishonoured obligations toward significant other persons, and instills a feeling
of shame together with the motivation to further abstain. A new appreciation for the love of family is
promoted and its cooperative support is emphasized. Naikan therapy courses of all-day concentrated selfscrutiny for one week are mainly practised in institutional settings, followed by shorter daily sessions and
post-discharge involvement in the Danshukai movement.


Evaluation: One follow-up study of 129 alcoholics treated by Naikan therapy elicited that 53% were
totally abstinent six months after discharge and 49% were abstinent after one yearc (Suwaki, 1979, 1980;
Takemoto et al., 1979)


Therapeutic approaches based on Arab Islamic traditions


The integration oflslamic spiritual approaches in the therapy of drug addiction has been pioneered in Egypt
(Baasher & Abu El Azayem, 1980; Abu El Azayem, 1987) and Saudi Arabia (AI Radi, 1990).


In 1977 a treatment unit for drug addicts was established at the Abu El Azayem Mosque in Cairo, in which
the religious leader assumed special functions in the therapeutic team by holding group meetings, providing
religious teaching with emphasis on Islamic injunctions regarding dependence-producing substance use,
strengthening social ties and encouraging mosque-centred activities, counselling on personal matters and
organizing social support. Propagation of anti-drug messages through religious media and during Friday
mass prayers served preventive purposes and promoted the rehabilitation of drug addicts in the community.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 176


Evaluation: In subsequent years, both the number of new cases reporting to the mosque clinic and the
compliance rate was found to be significantly higher than at other city clinics without a religious component,
while treatment at the mosque clinic was also more cost-effective. A comparative double-blind study
showed that substance addicts treated at the mosque clinic realized a significantly higher number of
therapeutic objectives than equivalent clients at a "normal" clinic (Abu El Azayem, 1987).


According to information provided by WHO/EMRO, spiritual counselling based on Islamic traditions is
currently ( 1991) provided in several mosques in Cairo where drug addicts, after chemical detoxification,
are helped by religious leaders to manage their guilt and return to a healthy lifestyle.


In Saudi Arabia, the addiction unit at Shahar Hospital, Taif, has for several years now integrated a
programme of religious therapy in which the mosque is the centre of therapeutic activity. Behavioural
changes are engendered in group therapy following prayer sessions with joint worship and recitation of the
holy scriptures.


Evaluation: The importance of fostering a religious motivation rather than other motivations for attaining
abstinence in Saudi drug addicts was shown in a follow-up study. The comparison of relapse rates in
patients of the Shahar Hospital Addiction Unit showed that 75% of probands with "inner religious
considerations" maintained abstinence over two years, as compared to 33% of probands motivated by other
considerations (Al Radi, 1990).


Alaska Eskimo spirit movement


The Inupiag Ilitgsat or Eskimo Spirit Movement was initiated in the early 1980s by the Northwest Alaska
Native Association is response to the increasing rates of alcohol abuse and related psychosocial problems
facing Alaskan native communities. There was the feeling that Eskimos were losing control of their lives
by leaving the responsibility for solving these problems to outside agencies. The movement is based on
traditional Eskimo values that include sharing, caring for others, responsibility for one's own people,
knowledge of language and customs, pride in one's cultural heritage, respect for the elders and their
inclusion in family life. The main rehabilitative and preventive instrument of the Eskimo Spirit Movement
is the "Spirit Camp" which provides a cultural learning and therapy experience for young Eskimos involved
in substance abuse, as well as those at risk. Without modern conveniences, young people in the Spirit Camp
acquire knowledge of Eskimo heritage and traditional survival skills from the elders and thus regain their
lost cultural identity. Traditional methods of healing employed in the rehabilitation programme include
body manipulation and massage, hydrotherapy, herbal remedies and group rituals.


Acceptability and public support: The Eskimo Spirit Movement has the active support of the new
Commissioner for Health of the State of Alaska (himself an Eskimo) who encourages the close
collaboration of health and social service officers and professionals with indigenous therapeutic and
preventive resources. The commissioner has likened the impact of the Eskimo Spirit Movement on
indigenous alcoholism problems to that of Alcoholics Anonymous in western societies. The Eskimo Spirit
Movement is widely popular among native leaders in Northwest Alaska since it provides a culture-congenial
approach to the substance abuse issue by addressing a need for positive cultural identification and


WHO/PSA/93 .10

page 177


meaningful activity among the young. The Eskimo Spirit Movement is an inspiring example to Inupiaq and
Inuit (Eskimo) representatives all parts of the Arctic (Jilek, unpubl.notes; Mala, 1985a, 1985b.).


North American Indian AA style groups


Western-type Alcoholics Anonymous has in general not been successful among North American Indian
populations for many reasons (Heath, 1983). However, where North American Indian alcoholics have been
inspired by western AA to organize self-help groups which incorporate important indigenous culture
elements and omit certain western features of philosophy and practice, such transformed AA style groups
in British Columbia and Nevada have been quite successful in attracting and rehabilitating alcohol-abusing
persons among native populations.


Amerindian AA-style groups first came into being among the Coast Salish Indians in the 1960s and
developed certain features. The concept of anonymity was rejected in favour of the open identification of
participants and open meetings to which family members, including children, were invited. Western-type
formality in conducting meetings with a defined membership according to set rules of procedure and time
frame was abandoned in favour of more traditional ways of congregating, without predetermined times of
arrival or departure of the participants who included extended family and community members.


Indian AA-style meetings are often not unlike spiritual ceremonials in which the "higher power" as
understood in AA philosophy becomes identified with the personal spirit power as understood in the
traditional guardian spirit complex. Meetings may also assume the pattern of traditional exchange feasts
(potlatch) whenever there is an occasion to commemorate anniversaries of sobriety, with solemn speeches
echoing the traditional mythology theme of death and rebirth into a new and healthier existence. The
Indian-White conflict, intimately associated with the history of Amerindian alcohol use and abuse, is
resolved in Amerindian AA-style groups by emphasizing cultural identity and self-respect while extending
friendship to White members of the general AA.


The success of the culturally transformed Amerindian AA style movement is shown by the fact that there
are now such groups not only in most Coast Salish communities but also among other Amerindian
populations of British Columbia and neighbouring areas (Jilek-Aall, 1978, 1981, Leland, 1978).


Revived traditional ceremonials of North American Indians


The Sweat Lodge Ceremony


Some ancient North American Indian ceremonials have been revived. Examples relevant to the combat
against substance abuse are the cult dance ceremonials and the Sweat Lodge ceremony. This latter
ceremony is today widely practised throughout the indigenous communities in North America. It offers
participation on a regular basis, without seasonal restrictions, both on and off reservations and even to
Amerindian inmates in federal prisons of Canada and the USA.


Sweat lodges are easily erected, being merely small, dome-shaped structures made of arched willow poles
tied together and tightly covered by blankets. Water is sprinkled on hot rocks placed in the centre to create


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 178


steam that, in the enclosed space, produces intense sweating in the small group of users who sit in a circle
facing the centre. Beyond the physiotherapeutic effects of intense sweats and the ensuing feeling of
serenity, there is a powerful somato-psychosocial experience created both by the religious ritual imbued of
the lodge representing archetypal symbols and by the group therapeutic interaction under the guidance of
a spiritual leader.


The revived Sweat Lodge ceremony has become a pan-Amerindian symbol of the resurgence of indigenous
culture and is a focus for nativistic strivings to regain an Amerindian identity and way of life free from
harmful influences of"White" majority society, notably from alcohol and drug abuse. Among Amerindians
the Sweat Lodge is considered an antidote for alcohol that has strong physical and mental consequences.
Many Sweat Lodge ritual leaders are rehabilitated alcoholics relying on involvement in this and other
revived Amerindian ceremonials for their sobriety, and who are role models for young Amerindian people
at risk. Participation in the Sweat Lodge ceremony combined with involvement in other revived Amerindian
ceremonials (for example in the cult dances, in the Amerindian AA-style groups and in indigenous sport
activities) creates a year-round rehabilitation programme and protection against relapse for some
Amerindian alcohol and drug abusers.


The Sun Dance


The Sun Dance of Amerindian tribes in Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado and the Dakotas, the Winter
Spirit Dance of the Coast Salish of British Columbia and Washington, and the Plains Indian Gourd
Dance, which now has a pan-Indian connotation, were adapted to current psychosocial needs. They were
given a therapeutic emphasis geared to the management and prevention of personality problems related to
culture change. Alcohol and drug abuse among younger Amerindians is typically associated with the
"anomic depression" related to anomie, relative deprivation and cultural identity confusion (cf. Jilek, 197 4 ).
Initiation to the Winter Spirit Dance and Sun Dance ceremonials involves the utilization of culturecongenial physiological and psychological techniques to produce altered states of consciousness under the
guidance of experienced ritualists. The initiation process is designed to help novices build up their personal
and cultural identity in order to establish a healthy new existence. This is achieved in a symbolic process
of ritualized death and rebirth through traditional means of personality deprogramming and subsequent
resynthesis and reorientation.


The therapeutic effects of traditional group ceremonials involve ritualized altered states of consciousness
due on the psychological level to cathartic abreaction, deflection of feelings of guilt and shame, 23-133
gratification of frustrated emotional needs in the supportive group milieu and symbolic expression of
otherwise hidden feelings in front of an empathic audience. Some initiates into the Winter Spirit Dance
ceremonial have likened their ecstatic experience to the transient "high" previously felt under the influence
of mind-changing drugs only without the withdrawal effects.


On the social level, participation in a ceremonial group helps in the resolution of interpersonal,
intergenerational and interfamily problems by altering social relationships and creating a new social
network. In addition there is the opportunity of graduating to the prestigious position of ritualist leader after
converting from a powerless substance dependent into a supernaturally sanctioned help-provider imbued
with spirit power. Ritualist leaders exert therapeutic influence through example and advice and, most


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 179


importantly, through the manipulation of culturally validated symbols in a setting conducive to collective
suggestion and social learning.


Evaluation of signifance for substance use prevention and rehabilitation: The message of leading
ritualists in the revived Amerindian cult dance ceremonials is that alcohol (still by far the most prevalent
of abused substance among Amerindians) is a poison historically introduced into Amerindian societies by
outsiders, often with pernicious motivations. Thus drinking and drug use are "non-Indian" and are signs
of alienation from aboriginal culture. Leading ritualists and prominent participants in the ceremonials are
total abstainers. New dancers have to abstain during the time of preparation, initiation, and training; active
dancers abstain or restrict their alcohol intake during the dancing season.


The contemporary Sun Dance is usually conducted over three days and nights in summer but requires
months of preparation along with total abstinence. To show their commitment, dancers often take a sacred
vow to "dance with pierced flesh", or hooked to the centre pole, in consecutive annual ceremonies. The
Winter Spirit dancing season in the Coast Salish region lasts about five months from late fall to spring.
Persons under the influence of alcohol are not supposed to attend the ceremonies even as spectators. This
has a discouraging effect on alcohol consumption in the area where ceremonies are held, as intake without
intoxication is unappealing and major ceremonial occasions draw many spectators and conflict with
weekend drinking parties.


Alcohol-related problems have significantly decreased in some Coast Salish reservations where community
leaders promoted the revival of ceremonial activity and the creation of Indian AA-style groups and where
educated younger persons participate actively in ceremonies to demonstrate their "Indianness". In a followup study of24 young Coast Salish Indians with alcohol and/or drug abuse problems who were initiated into
the Winter Spirit Dance between 1967 and 1972, 10 were fully rehabilitated and abstinent in 1973 for one
or more years after their initiation, 11 showed significant improvement, two showed no change and one
deteriorated (Jilek, 1982).


In the Upper Stalo population surveyed by the author, there were about 50 active spirit dancers among some
2000 Amerindian people in 1972, five years after revival of the ceremonial had started. New initiates have
since been entering the ceremonial every year in Coast Salish communities of southern British Columbia
and northern Washington. It can be said that the revival of the Winter Spirit Dance has created an annual
therapeutic programme in which not only the initiated dancers but also relatives and friends participate in
a group enterprise, providing mutual support, acceptance and stimulation. The effectiveness of the Winter
Spirit Dance ceremony in motivating substance abusers to sobriety was confirmed independently by two
investigators (Anderson, 1986).


The Sun Dance ceremony has been growing steadily in popularity since the 1960s. It involves teams of
singer-dnunmers in addition to the active dancers, with crowds of spectators to encourage them. The "panIndian" Gourd Dance is performed nowadays on many festive occasions by Amerindians throughout North
America and has been credited in rehabilitating alcoholics (Howard, 1976), although its impact is limited
owing to the absence of a rigorous and formal initiation process comparable to that of the other two cult
dances.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 180


Acceptability and risks: The cult dance ceremonials appealed to those among the younger generation who
were reached by the pan-Amerindian culture propaganda which emerged in the 1960s and emphasized the
re-attainment of an aboriginal identity in opposition to the overwhelming influence of majority society. The
ceremonies are opposed by society and some Amerindians who perceive them as outdated, "primitive" or
"pagan". Opposition is based on Christian fundamentalism, modem Western views on young individuals'
rights to chose an lifestyle irrespective of group concerns and traditions, and concern about the risks
involved in arduous training and practices that may cause pain, injury and, in extreme cases, the death of
individuals with pre-existing organic damage due to chronic alcoholism. In the majority, society there have
been calls for legal measures instituting public supervision of the ceremonials and official screening of
candidates for initiation, but today's government authorities in North America have categorically refused
any legal infringement that would in the end uppress these revived ceremonies that have a valuable
psychohygienic and sociotherapeutic function.


One of the most important aspects of all revived traditional Amerindian ceremonies is that they turn
participants away from egocentric and hedonistic preoccupations towards constructive community concerns
(Anderson, 1986; Hall, 1986; Howard, 1976; Jilek, 1974, 1978, 1981, 1982a, 1982b, 1989a; Jorgensen,
1972).


Syncretistic religious cults ofNorth American Indians


Native American Church (Peyote Cult)


The original pre-Columbian worship of the divine cactus called _peyote_ by the Aztecs survives among the
Mexican Huichol Indians. The Peyote Cult spread northward toward the end of the 19th century. Through
syncretic amalgamation of Christian forms with the religious symbolism of many Amerindian tribes the cult
became the Native American Church, today one of the most important pan-Amerindian religious
movements between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi with a membership number in the thousands.


The avowed purpose of participation in the Peyote Cult is to allay physical and mental distress and to
combat alcoholism by enhancing health and strength through communication with supernatural powers
made accessible in an arduous ritual. Collective goals are to create positive feelings among fellowpeyotists, their relatives and friends, and in general to promote pan-Amerindian ideals by "walking the
peyote road" in strict adherence to the principles of temperance ("alcohol and peyote do not mix"), honesty
and social reliability.


Evaluation: Most active members of the Native American Church are total abstainers from alcohol and
other chemical substances. The success of the Native American Church in rehabilitating Amerindians from
alcohol and opiate dependence and the safety of ritual peyote use have been confirmed by experienced
clinicians such as Professor Karl Menninger. Therapeutic efficacy is sometimes attributed to·the bioactive
and psychoactive ingredients of the ritually consumed peyote buttons of the cactus _Lophophora williamsi_
_Lemaire,which_ are st:Iychnine-like and hallucinogenic alkaloids (notably mescaline) as well as neuroactive
isoquinolines. There is evidence, however, that the therapeutically important altered state of consciousness
experienced during the night-long cult sessions may be induced by exposure to continuous rhythmic
dnunming and agglutinative chanting alone, without any ingestion of peyote buttons. The altered state of


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 181


consciousness facilitates the often cathartic expression of personal problems and pent-up emotions in front
of an empathic audience. The ritual leader's message of sobriety and responsibility for one's own health and
the welfare of one's people, repeatedly perceived in a suggestible state, has a good chance to become
incorporated in the person's lifestyle (Aberle, 1966; Albaugh & Anderson, 1974; Bergman, 1971; Blum
et al., 1977; Jilek, 1978; Pascarosa & Futterman, 1976; Pascarosa et al., 1976; Roy, 1973).


**Gaiwiio (Handsome Lake Movement)**


The "new" Iroquois religion of Handsome Lake, the native prophet of the early 1800s, is still a vital force
among the "Six Nations" Amerindians of New York and Ontario. Handsome Lake's revelation depicted
gruesome eternal punishments for those drinking "fire-water". The Handsome Lake movement became
established as an Amerindian church after his death, combining elements of pre-contact Iroquois culture
with the prophet's original vision and Christian principles. The prophet's demand for temperance led to the
first aboriginal anti-alcohol movement and was enshrined in the _Code of Handsome Lake_ in the 1840s.
It is still the doctrine of the followers of Gaiwiio who combine a desire for personal spiritual salvation with
identification as true Iroquois. The opposition to vices introduced by majority society, such as alcohol and
drug abuse is seen as affmning the Indianness of the Amerindians who now practise the revived indigenous
ceremonials on the plains and on the Pacific coast (Heath 1983; Jilek-Aall, 1978; Wallace, 1972).


**Indian Shaker Church**


Founded by the ex-alcoholic John Slocum in 1881, this messianic cult with Catholic form and nativistic
content had followers on many Indian reservations in the Pacific Northwest and reached its peak in the
1920s. Slocum taught that those who had received the Shaker spirit ("shake") obtained the power to heal
others and to lead a wholesome life themselves, but that they would die if they resumed drinking alcohol,
even one drop. The Shaker Church has been consistent in its insistence on total sobriety of its members.
In recent decades, some Shakers have merged with "White" fundamentalist Christian groups. Those more
conscious of Indianness are now actively participating in the revived Winter Spirit Dance ceremonial and
in the Amerindian AA-style groups. Nowadays there is no strict delimitation in the Pacific Northwest
between these indigenous movements which all emphasize freedom from alcohol and drug use as part of
traditional values. They also share the archetypal birth and rebirth myth. The prophets Handsome Lake
and John Slocum both "died" of alcohol abuse and were reborn to a new life, just as the faulty old self "dies"
in the Spirit Dance initiation ordeal and the alcoholic "nearly died" before reaching sobriety through
Amerindian AA-style groups (Bamett, 1957; Collins, 1950; Gunther, 1949; Jilek-Aall, 1978).


**Folk healing in Latin America**


Latin American folk healing is influenced by aboriginal Amerindian beliefs and traditional medicine, by
populist Catholicism and by modem spiritism.


Unfortunately for the campaign against the prevalent alcohol abuse in Latin America, the possession-trance
cults which are derived from West African religions and which have developed into religious-therapeutic
enterprises never acquired an anti-alcohol emphasis. There are millions of participants in the Caribbean


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 182


(Vodun, Santeria, Shango) and in Brazil (Umbanda, absorbing Candomble and Macumba) whose ritualist
leaders still resort to the ceremonial use of rum.


Espiritismo


The example ofEspiritismo, a healing religion which developed from amalgamation of the Afro-Caribbean
possession cult Santeria with Christian and spiritist elements, demonstrates that group therapeutic
movements involving altered states of consciousness have considerable potential for the rehabilitation of
alcohol and drug dependents among Latin Americans. This is exemplified by Puerto Rican Espiritismo
centres in the eastern USA (Singer & Borrero, 1984). Spiritual consultations are provided by Espiritistas,
usually themselves rehabilitated substance abusers. They interpret problem causation within the magicoreligious and sociocultural belief system of their patients and employ individual and family counselling
techniques of confrontation, suggestion and manipulation. They also use "spiritual treatment" involving
symbolic rituals of cleansing with herbal baths, plus prayer sessions, exorcism and magical protection.
Spiritual treatment is designed to break the grip of malevolent spirits causing the patient's alcoholism, thus
relieving guilt and changing the family's attitude towards him.


Evaluation: In one typical Espiritismo centre, more than 1,000 problem drinkers were treated in a threeyear period. Although complete abstinence was the declared therapeutic goal, only reduced consumption
and improved personal and family function could be achieved in the majority of cases. Costs were minimal.


Mexican Folk Medicine


In Mexican Folk Medicine (Arredondo et al., 1987; Trotter & Chavira, 1978; Trotter, 1979) alcoholics are
treated by involving the family. Counselling is through religious exercises, magical rituals and symbolic
acts removing supernatural causes, as well as through the social engineering of charismatic Curanderos.
Sedative herbal teas are administered to control nervous symptoms after the cessation of drinking. Nauseainducing substances such as powderized old eggs or rat urine may be put into the alcoholic's drink
surreptitiously to diminish his desire to drink. Of interest is the Antabuse-like (disulfiram) aversion
therapy employed by some Mexican healers and herbalists using toasted and ground seeds of _haba de San_
_lgnacio (Hura polyandra_ _L._ and _Hura crepitans_ _L.),_ containing toxalbumines that induce nausea and
vomiting in conjunction with subsequent intake of alcohol. A similar example in Ecuador is the Pavloviantype deconditioning with emetic herbal teas prepared from the _nepe_ root, to be taken by the alcoholic
together with beer, or in a healing compound of the Colorados Indians (the latter is mostly frequented by
urban patients) (Jilek-Aall & Jilek, 1983).


Peruvian Folk Healing


In Peruvian Folk Healing chronic alcoholics are treated by curanderos especially in the northern Coast area
(Chiappe Costa, 1970; Chiappe Costa et al., 1972; Chiappe et al., 1985; Seguin, 1974). The folketiological theol)' of causation of alcoholism and other afflictions by a _dano,_ a harmful magical substance
slipped into the patient's drink or food by a malvolent person, is utilized by the _curandero_ to turn the
alcoholic from a social offender into that of a victim who can count on the sympathy of family and friends
facilitating his rehabilitation. In a diagnostic session, the healer enters an altered state of consciousness


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 183


induced by ingesting the sacred San Pedro cactus _(Trichocereus pachanoi),_ which contains mescaline and
other psychoactive substances. In this state the healer signals the person(s) responsible for the _dano_ by
means of a supernaturally-sanctioned authority. Through this naming process, the divining healer is able

to modify the patient's and the family's attitude and can manipulate social relationships, e.g. by making the
patient avoid undesirable drinking companions.


In order to qualify for the actual treatment, the patient has to submit to severe restrictions on alcohol
consumption for about one month while following a special diet and drinking herbal tonics for physical
strengthening. The subsequent treatment starts with common curing rites of Peruvian folk medicine. The
patient then undergoes an intensive aversion therapy in which herbal emetics and laxatives induce vomiting
and diarrhoea while he is offered alcoholic drinks. For this arduous treatment the patient is often admitted

to the healing compound of the _curandero,_ usually together with his mother or spouse and sometimes even
the entire family. After discharge, the patient is given a protective charm and is supposed to make regular
visits to the healer for several months.


Evaluation: In one foliow-up study by the Instituto de Psiquiatria Social, Universidad Nacional Mayor
de San Marco (Chiappe Costa, 1972), 39 of 57 chronic alcoholics treated by _curanderos_ were found to be
fully rehabilitated, 77% with post-therapy abstinence periods of over one year and 44% over six years.
Eighteen of the 57 probands relapsed since receiving treatment, _56%_ of them within eight months, 78%
within 16 months and 89% within two years.


Syncretistic religious cults in Southern Africa


The independent Black-African churches of southern Africa, also known as Zionist, Ethiopian or Apostolic,
combine messianic Christianity and pan-African consciousness with traditional elements of Bantu culture
and a mandate to heal spiritually, mentally and physically. In the Republic of South Africa, Malawi and
Namibia, these churches, often led by charismatic prophet-healers, have a numerous though rapidly
changing membership and considerable socio-political influence. Members are subject to proscriptions
which usually nclude an injunction against the consumption of alcoholic beverages and, in many cases,
against the use of other drugs.


The religious prohibition is, however, associated with a readiness to rehabilitate the repentent substance
dependent as a patient in the context of the church's healing mandate, usually with no charge beyond the
general tithing. A confession is expected with free admission of personal problems. In many congregations
this confession is combined with purification rites for the "elimination of all evil", both spiritual and
material, by ritual vomiting and body cleansing. Counselling is conducted by faith healers and ex-alcoholic
church members. There is often dream interpretation by authorized leaders as well.


In Malawi the alcohol and drug (cannabis) rehabilitation programme of Zionist church groups is divided
into spiritual therapy (purification by sprinkling with blessed water, songs and prayers, spiritual rebirth
through river baptism), a common practice in most congregations, and body therapy. The latter is seen as
a kind of detoxification treatment of withdrawal symptoms and consists of two elements - first the oral
administration of exactly dosed fluids (concentrated salt solution, tea, lake water, milk, coffee, oil)
distributed over a course of 28 days and then body stimulation at specified asymmetric points of head, trunk


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 184


and extremities, performed at 70 points with a wooden stick and at 60 different points with a needle. Some
of these points appear identical to acupuncture points also used in the treatment of alcoholics, but there is
no known historical or contemporary connection.


Evaluation: A study conducted in Malawi (Peltzer, 1987) indicated that the average time of alcohol
abstinence after joining a healing church was 2. 8 years. A follow-up investigation of 11 men with alcohol
and cannabis related disorders treated in a Zionist church showed that after six months, five were regular
church attenders and abstinent, two were drinking again, one had died after relapse and three could not be
followed. Thus the therapy can be considered relatively successful. In the alcohol rehabilitation programme
of another church which does not feature physical treatment (body therapy), the results were less successful:
after six months only one of five men remained abstinent, two had relapsed and two could not be found
(Benz, 1965; Peltzer, 1987; Sundkler, 1961).


EFFICACY OF TRADITIONAL HEALING


On the basis of the data presented in the above geographical overview, it can be stated that the many general
observations and the few investigations reported by scientific observers allow the following overall
conclusion: in the rehabilitation and prevention of chemical substance dependence, therapeutic modalities
based on indigenous cultural and religious traditions are found in general to be as successful as, and in some
instances more successful than, "official" treatment and rehabilitation programmes.


ADVANTAGES OF TRADITIONAL HEALING APPROACHES IN COMPARISON
WITH THE MEDICAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM


Culture-Congeniality


Traditional healers and ritualists share the socio-cultural value system of their clientele.


Personality of the healer


Traditional healing recognizes the importance of the personality characteristics of the therapist who
achieves and maintains a confidence-inspiring charisma. In modem medicine the therapeutic technique,
rather than the personality of the therapist, is assumed to be the most important variable.


Holistic approach


Traditional healing practices usually integrate physical, psychologicaL spiritual and social methods as
opposed to modem medicine which is becoming increasingly fragmented through over-specializing and
technologizing.


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 185


Accessibility and availability


Traditional healers are the first resort in most developing areas due more to their geographical permanence
and accessibility than their therapeutic merits. Modem health staff tend to be urban located, highly mobile
and changing.


Affectivity therapy and altered states of consciousness


Traditional healing utilizes suggestive methods and the manipulation of culturally validated images and
symbols, working on the patient's affectivity to achieve the therapeutic goal rather than relying on rational
understanding and "insight" in order to correct faulty behaviour. The effective utilization of altered states
of consciousness, induced by physiological and psychological means in the ritual therapy of substance
dependence, is of special interest in view of the assumed interrelationship of such states with opiate
receptors and the neuroendocrine opioid system (cf. Lex & Schor, 1977; Prince, 1982).


Collective therapy management


Traditional healing in most cases also involves the patient's kinspeople and other community members who
may join forces with healer and patient to define the underlying problem and remedial action. Traditional
therapies therefore tend to be relational; they tend to foster kinship and community cohesion to facilitate
the patient's re-integration.


Social engineering


The traditional healer's advice carries weight through his prestige and charisma and may in some cases also
be sanctioned by supernatural authority. The healer is therefore in a position to manipulate directly or
indirectly the patient's immediate human environment to favour the achieving of the therapeutic goal.


Cost effectiveness


There is no doubt that utilization of traditional therapeutic resources is considerably more cost-effective for
the public than utilization of the official health service since public funds need not be invested beyond
occasional grants to deserving non-profit treatment operations. Consumer costs of utilizing traditional
healing vary and are usually individualized; often there is no obligatory fee, but instead an expectation of
donations, often in kind. It is worth noting that cost considerations have not impeded utilization of
traditional healing resources in many of the countries where health care services, including substance abuse
rehabilitation, are free or covered by state insurance schemes.


WHO/PSA/93.10
page 186


DISADVANTAGES OF TRADITIONAL HEALING APPROACHES


Difficulties of supervision and control


The secrecy surrounding some traditional procedures along with the religious aspects of many healing
ceremonials make effective supervision by health authorities difficult. Attempts by unsympathetic health
professionals at imposing controls could have a discouraging effect. However, traditional healers respond
positively to professionals who seek their collaboration in an attitude of respect and genuine understanding.
Traditional healers are willing to share information and take advice in a collaborative relationship that
entails mutual referrals of patients.


Potentially harmful treatments


Certain procedures and remedies used by traditional healers, usually with imprecise dosage, may cause
physical harm. This can be due to toxic effects, especially when "purgation" or aversion therapies are
applied, or it may occur when the patient's reduced physical condition places him or her at special risk, e.g.
if the patient has alcohol or drug-induced organic damage. However, many medications used in modem
medical treatments may also have unintended harmful effects (such as habituation) and that the risk of
ongoing substance abuse in most cases outweighs the risks of even the most drastic intervention.


GEOGRAPIDCAL OVERVIEW OF LEGAL REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO THE
PRACTICE OF HEALTH CARE


Prohibitive restrictions


Countries with prohibitive legislation reserving the right to provide health care exclusively to physicians,
dentists, midwives and nurses trained at recognized schools and licensed by state-authorized bodies are:
Austria, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the former Soviet Union, and the former socialist countries of
Eastern Europe. In Algeria and Mongolia policy changes in this direction are under consideration.


De facto toleration of non-professional health care


Prohibitive restrictions of non-professional health care which were introduced by European colonial
authorities are no longer enforced in those countries formerly under Belgian, Dutch, French and Spanish
colonial jurisdiction that have not yet issued new legal regulations. The current situation is one of de facto
toleration, and in some countries even official promotion, of traditional healing despite the fact that old laws
have not yet been formally repealed.


De iure toleration of non-professional health care


Countries where the official health care system is based on licensed professionals with recognized academic
qualifications and degrees who also enjoy certain exclusive privileges, but where healing by "non-scientific"
methods is nevertheless not legally prohibited are: Germany, Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries,


WHO/PSA/93.10

page 187


United Kingdom and the USA (regulations differ according to state but tolerance is assured nationwide by
the constitutional "right to privacy").


Legalization of traditional healing practices


Developing countries with legalization legalizing the practice of traditional medicine or exempting such
practice from the prohibition of unauthorized health care under various defined conditions are: Burkina
Faso, Fiji, Ghana, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malaysia, Mali, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South
Africa, Tanzania, Tonga and Uganda.


It is noted that in many developing countries legal obstacles to close collaboration between health
professionals and traditional healers are still in existence due to unchanged regulations of professional
conduct This is the case notwithstanding either implemented or planned legalization of traditional medicine
practices, or policy statements in national health plans or the efforts made by WHO since the 1978
conference of Alma Ata to promote the integrated cooperation of modern and traditional health care
resources (Akerele, 1987).


Legally sanctioned coexistence


Countries with legally sanctioned coexistence of recognized traditional medicine systems and modern
medical health care are: Bangladesh (recognized: Ayurveda, Unani), Burma (recognized: "Indigenous
Burmese Medicine"), India (recognized: Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani), Pakistan (recognized: Ayurveda,
Unani), Sri Lanka (recognized: Ayurveda), Thailand (recognized: "Old-fashioned Art of healing").


Official integration


Countries with an official policy of integrating recognized traditional medicine systems and modern medical
health care are: Democratic People's Republic of Korea (recognized: Traditional Korean and Chinese
Medicine), Nepal (recognized: Ayurveda) and People's Republic of China (recognized: Traditional Chinese
Medicine).


Note: In the countries listed as having policies of legally sanctioned coexistence or official integration of
traditional medicine systems, other forms of traditional healing, such as shamanic folk healing, are not
legally recognized, and may actually be discouraged (Jilek, unpubl.notes; Stepan, 1983).
