**EMOTION REGULATION HANDOUT 3**

      (Emotion Regulation Worksheets 2–2c)


**What Emotions Do for You**


**EMOTIONS MOTIVATE (AND ORGANIZE) US FOR ACTION**


  - Emotions motivate our behavior. Emotions prepare us for action.

The action urge of specific emotions is often “hard-wired” in biology.


  - Emotions save time in getting us to act in important situations.

Emotions can be especially important when we don’t have time to think things through.


  - Strong emotions help us overcome obstacles—in our minds and in the environment.


**EMOTIONS COMMUNICATE TO (AND INFLUENCE) OTHERS**


  - Facial expressions are hard-wired aspects of emotions.

Facial expressions communicate faster than words.


  - Our body language and voice tone can also be hard-wired.

Like it or not, they also communicate our emotions to others.


  - When it is important to communicate to others, or send them a message,

it can be very hard to change our emotions.


  - Whether we intend it or not, our communication of emotions influences others.


**EMOTIONS COMMUNICATE TO OURSELVES**


  - Emotional reactions can give us important information about a situation.

Emotions can be signals or alarms that something is happening.


  - Gut feelings can be like intuition—a response to something important about the situation.
This can be helpful if our emotions get us to check out the facts.


  - **Caution:** Sometimes we treat emotions as if they are facts about the world: The stronger
the emotion, the stronger our belief that the emotion is based on fact. (Examples: “If I feel
unsure, I am incompetent,” “If I get lonely when left alone, I shouldn’t be left alone,” “If I feel
confident about something, it is right,” “If I’m afraid, there must be danger,” “I love him, so
he must be OK.”)


  - If we assume that our emotions represent facts about the world, we may use them to justify
our thoughts or our actions. This can be trouble if our emotions get us to ignore the facts.

**EMOTION REGULATION HANDOUT 8**

(Emotion Regulation Worksheet 5 )


**Check the Facts**


**FACTS**







Many emotions and actions are set off by our thoughts and interpretations of events,
not by the events themselves.


**Event** **Thoughts** **Emotions**


Our emotions can also have a big effect on our thoughts about events.


**Event** **Emotion** **Thoughts**


Examining our thoughts and _checking the facts_ can help us change our emotions.


**HOW TO CHECK THE FACTS**

**1. Ask: What is the emotion I want to change?**

_(See Emotion Regulation Handout 6: Ways of Describing Emotions.)_


**2. Ask: What is the event prompting my emotion?**
Describe the facts that you observed through your senses.
Challenge judgments, absolutes, and black-and-white descriptions.

_(See Mindfulness Handout 4: Taking Hold of Your Mind: “What” Skills.)_


**3. Ask: What are my interpretations, thoughts, and assumptions about the**
**event?**
Think of other possible interpretations.
Practice looking at all sides of a situation and all points of view.
Test your interpretations and assumptions to see if they fit the facts.

**4. Ask: Am I assuming a threat?**
Label the threat.
Assess the probability that the threatening event will really occur.
Think of as many other possible outcomes as you can.

**5. Ask: What’s the catastrophe?**
Imagine the catastrophe really occurring.
Imagine coping well with a catastrophe (through problem solving, coping
ahead, or radical acceptance).

**6. Ask: Does my emotion and/or its intensity fit the actual facts?**
Check out facts that fit each emotion.
Ask Wise Mind.

**Nightmare Protocol, Step by Step**
When Nightmares Keep You from Sleeping


**1. Practice relaxation, pleasant imagery, and coping skills first, to be sure**
**you are ready to work on changing your nightmares.**
Do progressive relaxation, paced breathing, and/or Wise Mind exercises;
listen to music or guided imagery; review the distress tolerance crisis survival
skills.


**2. Choosearecurring nightmare you would like to work on.**

This will be your target nightmare. Select a nightmare you can manage now.
Put off trauma nightmares until you are ready to work with them—or, if you
target a trauma nightmare, skip Step 3.


**3. Write down your target nightmare.**

Include sensory descriptions (sights, smells, sounds, tastes, etc.). Also
include any thoughts, feelings, and assumptions about yourself during the
dream.


**4. Chooseachanged outcome for the nightmare.**

The change should occur BEFORE anything traumatic or bad happens to you
or others in the nightmare. Essentially, you want to come up with a change
that will prevent the bad outcome of the usual nightmare from occurring. Write
an ending that will give you a sense of peace when you wake up.
_Note: Changes in the nightmare can be very unusual and out of the ordinary_
_(e.g., you might become a person with superhuman powers who is able_
_to escape to safety or fight off attackers). Changed outcomes can include_
_changed thoughts, feelings, or assumptions about yourself._



**5. Write down the full nightmare with the changes.**


**6. REHEARSE and RELAX each night before going to sleep.**

Rehearse the _changed_ nightmare by visualizing the entire dream with the
changes each night, _before_ practicing relaxation techniques.


**7. REHEARSE and RELAX during the day.**

Visualize the entire dream with the change, and practice relaxation as often
as possible during the day.

**EMOTION REGULATION HANDOUT 20B**

(Emotion Regulation Worksheet 14b)


**Sleep Hygiene Protocol**
When You Can’t Sleep, What to Do Instead of Ruminating

**TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESTFULNESS/SLEEP:**

**1. Develop and followaconsistent sleep schedule even on weekends.** Go to bed and get up
at the same times each day, and avoid anything longer than a 10-minute nap during the day.
**2. Do not use your bed in the daytime** for things like watching TV, talking on the phone, or
reading.
**3. Avoid** caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals, and exercise late in the day before going to
sleep.
**4. When prepared to sleep, turn off the light, and keep the room quiet and the**
**temperature comfortable and relatively cool.** Try an electric blanket if you are cold; putting
your feet outside of the blanket or turning on a fan directed toward your bed if you are hot; or
wearing a sleeping mask, using earplugs, or turning on a “white noise” machine if needed.
**5. Give yourself half an hour to at most an hour to fall asleep.** If it doesn’t work, evaluate
whether you are calm, or anxious (even if only “background anxiety”), or ruminating.
**6. DO NOT CATASTROPHIZE.** Remind yourself that you need rest, and aim for reverie (i.e.,
dreaminess) and resting your brain. Sell yourself on the idea that staying awake is not a
catastrophe. Do not decide to give up on sleeping for the night and get up for the “day.”

**IF YOU ARE CALM BUT WIDE AWAKE:**

**7. Get out of bed; go to another room and readabook** or do some other activity that will not
wake you up further. As you begin to get tired and/or sleepy, go back to bed.
**8. Tryalight snack** (e.g., an apple).

**IF YOU ARE ANXIOUS OR RUMINATING**

**9. Use the cold water TIP skill. Get right back in bed and do the paced breathing TIP skill.**

_(See Distress Tolerance Handout 6: TIP Skills: Changing Your Body Chemistry.)_
Remember, if you have any medical condition, get medical approval before using cold water.
**10. Try the 9–0 meditation practice.** Breathe in deeply and breathe out slowly, saying in your
mind the number 9. On the next breath out, say 8; then say 7; and so on until you breathe out
saying 0. Then start over, but this time start with 8 (instead of 9) as you breathe out, followed
by 7, and so on until you reach 0. Next start with 6 as you breathe out, and so on to 0. Then
start with 5, then with 4, and so on until you have gone all the way down to starting with 1. (If
you get lost, start over with the last number you remember.) Continue until you fall asleep.
**11. Focus on the bodily sensation** of the rumination (rumination is often escape from difficult
emotional sensations).
**12. Reassure yourself** that worries in the middle of the night are just “middle-of-the-nightthinking,” and that in the morning you will think and feel differently.
**13. Read an emotionally engrossing novel** for a few minutes until you feel somewhat tired. Then
stop reading, close your eyes, and try to continue the novel in your head.
**14. If rumination doesn’t stop,** follow these guidelines: “If it’s solvable, solve it. If it is insolvable,
go deep into the worry all the way to the “catastrophe”—the very worst outcome you can
imagine—and then imagine coping ahead with the catastrophe.

_(See Emotion Regulation Handout 19: Build Mastery and Cope Ahead.)_
**If nothing else works, with eyes closed, listen to public radio (BBC, NPR, etc.)** at low volume
(use headphones if necessary). Public radio is a good choice for this, because there is little fluctuation in voice tone or volume.

**Overview:**
**Managing Really Difficult Emotions**


**MINDFULNESS OF CURRENT EMOTIONS**


Suppressing emotion increases suffering.


Mindfulness of current emotions is the path to emotional freedom.


**MANAGING EXTREME EMOTIONS**


Sometimes emotional arousal is so high that you can’t use any skills,
particularly if the skills are complicated or take any thought on your part.


This is a skills breakdown point.


Crisis survival skills are needed.


**TROUBLESHOOTING AND REVIEW**


There are many ways to change emotions.


It can be helpful to have a list of the important skills
to look at when you can’t remember the skills you need to regulate
your emotions.

**Check the Facts**


Due Date: Name: Week Starting:

It is hard to problem-solve an emotional situation if you don’t have your facts straight. You must
know what the problem is before you can solve it. This worksheet helps you figure out whether
it is the event that is causing your emotion, your interpretation of the event, or both. Use your
mindfulness skills of observing and describing. Observe the facts, and then describe the facts you
have observed.



**Step**

**1**


**Step**

**2**





**Ask: What emotion do I want to change?**

**EMOTION NAME:** **INTENSITY (0–100) Before:** **After:**


**Ask: What is the PROMPTING EVENT for my emotional reaction?**

**DESCRIBE THE PROMPTING EVENT:** What happened that led you to have this
emotion? Who did what to whom? What led up to what? What is it about this event that
is a problem for you? Be very specific in your answers.


**CHECK THE FACTS!**



Look for extremes and judgments in the way you are describing the prompting event **.**




**[REWRITE ]** [the facts, if necessary, to be more accurate. ]
**Facts**




 

**Step**

**3**







**Ask: What are my INTERPRETATIONS (thoughts, beliefs, etc.) about the facts?**
What am I assuming? Am I adding my own interpretations to the description of the
prompting event?


**CHECK THE FACTS!**

List as many _other_ possible interpretations of the facts as you can.



**REWRITE** the facts, if necessary. Try to check the accuracy of your interpretations. If you
can’t check the facts, write out a likely or a useful (i.e., effective) interpretation.
**Facts**

**Step** **Ask: Am I assuming a THREAT?** What is the THREAT? What about this event or

**4** situation is threatening to me? What worrisome consequences or outcomes am I

expecting?



**4**



**CHECK THE FACTS!**

List as many _other_ possible outcomes as you can, given the facts.


**REWRITE** the facts if needed. Try to check the accuracy of your expectations. If you
can’t check out probable outcomes, write out a likely noncatastrophic outcome to
expect.



**Facts**

 






**Step** **Ask: What’s the CATASTROPHE, even if the outcome I am worrying about does**
**5** **occur?** Describe in detail the worst outcome I can reasonably expect.



**DESCRIBE WAYS TO COPE** if the worst does happen.





**Step** **ASK: Does my emotion (or its intensity or duration) FIT THE FACTS?**
**6** (0 = not at all to 5 = I am certain):



If you are unsure whether your emotion or your emotional intensity fits the facts (for
example, you give a score of 2, 3, or 4), keep checking the facts. Be as creative as you
can be; ask others for their opinions; or do an experiment to see if your predictions or
interpretations are correct.

**Figuring Out How to Change Unwanted Emotions**

Due Date: Name: Week Starting:

Once you have checked the facts, use this worksheet to help you figure out what to do next.
Before you can figure out what to change, you have to decide whether acting on your emotion
is effective in the situation you are in (and whether the emotion is one you actually want to
change). (If you are not sure whether you want to change it or not, go back to Emotion Regulation
Worksheet 1 and do pros and cons.) In the flow chart below, circle Yes or No at each level, and
then select the skill that fits your situation best.
