# **Anxiety Symptoms Worksheet**

Anxiety symptoms can often be grouped into 4 categories. Some symptoms are of the physical or body type, for example,
shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, lightheadedness, etc. Some symptoms are of the cognitive type which may include thought responses
such as, “People will notice that I am anxious”, “Something bad might happen”, etc. The third category of symptoms is to do with your feelings,
including anxiety or fear. Finally, the last category is behaviours or actions, for example: not going out, avoiding people, going out only with
people to whom you are close, etc.
