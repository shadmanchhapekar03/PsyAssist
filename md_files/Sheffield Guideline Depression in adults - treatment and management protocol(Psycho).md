**1. SUMMARY & INTRODUCTION**


This protocol has been developed to aid clinicians in primary care in the management of depression
in adults and older adults. The guideline includes recognition, diagnosis, management,
(pharmacological and non-pharmacological support) and when to consider referral to specialist care.
Please refer to NICE [Depression in adults: treatment and management (NG222) for further details,](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/Recommendations#recognition-and-assessment)
including evidence behind recommendations.

This protocol has been developed in collaboration with primary, secondary, voluntary sector, and
specialist care colleagues and involved patient engagement.


**2. RECOGNITION AND ASSESMENT**


Depression is referred to as a wide range of mental health problems, which are characterised by the
lack of positive affect. This includes loss of interest and enjoyment, low mood, and a range of
associated emotional, cognitive, physical, and behavioural symptoms.

[ICD-11](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/recommendations#depression) [and DSM-5](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/recommendations#depression) have produced criteria for depression identification.


Previously depression was categorised into 4 categories (subthreshold, mild, moderate and severe),
[but after NICE NG222](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/recommendations) it was changed to 2:

  - Less severe depression, which encompasses previously subthreshold and mild depression,
[and in NICE guideline is defined as depression scoring less than 16 on the PHQ-9](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1725/phq9-patient-health-questionnaire9) scale and

  - More severe depression, which encompasses moderate to severe depression and in NICE
[guideline is defined as depression scoring 16 or more on the PHQ-9](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1725/phq9-patient-health-questionnaire9) scale.

While PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) is a helpful tool, other factors below should be taken
into the consideration.

Please note that some patients presenting with chronic depressive symptoms might not have sought
[treatment previously or knew they have depression. NICE guidelines](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/resources/treatment-options-for-chronic-depression-depression-with-personality-disorder-or-psychotic-depression-pdf-11131007010) provide treatment options for
these patients. Additionally, see treatment algorithm.

**3. CHOICE OF TREATMENTS**


[Full scope of NICE treatment choices can be found here. While not all non-pharmacological services](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/Recommendations#delivery-of-treatments)
[outlined by NICE are available in Sheffield, majority will be and Talking Therapies](https://www.sheffieldtalkingtherapies.nhs.uk/) assessment will
enable most appropriate choice for the patient.
When assessing treatment choices consider any physical and co-existing mental health illness.
[Address barriers in patients with learning disabilities, autism](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng54) or [dementia. Also consider impact and](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng97)
[management if depression associated with antenatal and postnatal](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg192) [mental health, menopause and](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng23)
[chronic physical health.](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg91)
Discuss:


  - what, if anything, they think might be contributing to the development of their depression


  - whether they have ideas or preferences about starting treatment, and what treatment options
they have previously found helpful or might prefer


  - their experience of any prior episodes of depression, or treatments for depression


  - what they hope to gain from treatment

  - information on what treatments are recommended, their potential benefits and harms, any
waiting times for treatments, and the expected outcomes (see NICE [table 1 and table 2](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/Recommendations#treatment-for-a-new-episode-of-less-severe-depression) on the
recommended treatments for a new episode of less severe and more severe depression
respectively)

  - how treatment will be delivered (for example individual or group, in person or remotely) and
where they will be delivered

If depression is accompanied by symptoms of anxiety, which is particularly common in older people,
the prioritising should usually be to treat the depression. When the person has an anxiety disorder
[and comorbid depression or depressive symptoms, consult NICE guidance for the relevant anxiety](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/mental-health-behavioural-and-neurodevelopmental-conditions/anxiety/products?Status=Published&ProductType=Guidance)
[disorder](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/mental-health-behavioural-and-neurodevelopmental-conditions/anxiety/products?Status=Published&ProductType=Guidance) if available and consider treating the anxiety disorder first. [GAD-7](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1727/gad7-general-anxiety-disorder7) (General Anxiety Disorder7) can be used to assess patients with anxiety.

Match the choice of treatment to meet the needs and preferences of the person with depression. Use
the least intrusive and most resource efficient treatment or one that worked in the past.

When prescribing for people with depression who are aged 18-25 consider increased prevalence of
[suicide. Use risk management strategy e.g., limiting prescription supply, type of medication](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/resources/depression-in-adults-treatment-and-management-pdf-66143832307909#page=11&zoom=100,0,767)
prescribed. Prior issuing a prescription ensure mental state assessment, review 1 week after starting
antidepressant and again no later than 4 weeks after the medicine was started.

[Prescribers should be aware that there are voluntary sector support enterprises such as Flourish](https://sheffieldflourish.co.uk/) that
[are available for access. Sheffield mental health guide is a tool for finding available services in](https://www.sheffieldmentalhealth.co.uk/)
[Sheffield. This includes suicide prevention support advice.](https://www.sheffieldsuicidesupport.co.uk/)

**4. MEDICATION CHOICE**


There is little difference between classes of antidepressants in terms of efficacy. The choice should
be made according to patient requirements or circumstances:

  - Concomitant disease e.g., QTc interval prolongation, anxiety

  - Existing therapy e.g., interactions

  - Suicide risk

  - Desired effect e.g., increased appetite, sleep.

  - Response to previous antidepressant therapy

[Consider using choice and medication website for more depression and pharmacological treatment](https://www.choiceandmedication.org/sheffieldhsc/)
information. Most up to date comprehensive and comparative antidepressant study was published in
[2018 by Lancet and can be found here](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2817%2932802-7) (Cipriani et al. 2018). Consider most common antidepressant
side-effect in section 5.

Nice CKS advise that [Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/depression/prescribing-information/ssris/) (SSRIs) are well tolerated in comparison
[to older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and now less commonly monoamine oxidase inhibitors](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/depression/prescribing-information/tricyclic-antidepressants/)
(MAOIs). SSRIs are used mainly as first-line drug treatment for depression.

With all drugs there is marked inter-individual variation of tolerability, which is not easily predictable. A
flexible approach is required to find the right drug. For example, sertraline will be associated with
higher incidence of diarrhoea than other SSRIs and paroxetine will be more likely to cause weight
gain and sexual dysfunction than other SSRIs. Some antidepressants such as mirtazapine can be
beneficial when sedation is required. Other antidepressants such as TCAs should be used with
caution in patients with cardiac dysfunction and risk of overdose. Prescribing in elderly requires more
[consideration due to increased risk of comorbidity and change in pharmacokinetics (See here](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/medicines-guidance/prescribing-in-the-elderly/) for
[more information). For further information on antidepressant treatment see BNF summary.](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/treatment-summaries/antidepressant-drugs/#overview)

Patients suffering from anxiety and being treated for depression might require more time for a full
effect of antidepressant treatment to take place.
[Special consideration is required for young people as well as people at risk of suicide.](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/chapter/recommendations#antidepressant-medication-for-people-at-risk-of-suicide)
[Consider safe prescribing and withdrawal management (NICE NG215)](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng215/chapter/Recommendations#making-decisions-about-prescribing-and-taking-a-dependence-forming-medicine-or-antidepressant) when issuing drugs associated
with dependence.

**6. STOPPING AND SWITCHING ANTIDEPRESSANTS**


Patients who wish to reduce or stop antidepressants should be advised that reduction should be
[gradual. Abrupt stoppage can lead to withdrawal symptoms](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/antidepressants/withdrawal-effects-of-antidepressants/) that can range in severity and
presentation. If through shared decision making, it is decided to stop antidepressants [SPS,](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/articles/ssris-to-other-antidepressants-switching-in-adults/) [NICE CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/depression/prescribing-information/switching-antidepressants/)
and [RC Psych](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/stopping-antidepressants) provides a guide how to taper or stop medicines. See below for general principles of
treatment withdrawal or cross-tapering. Please note the regime needs to be tailored to individual
needs and most patients respond differently to same approaches.

**7. PREVENTING RELAPSE AND FURTHER LINE TREATMENT**


[NICE produced a useful guidance when making decisions on relapse](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/resources/preventing-relapse-pdf-11131007008) [and choices for further line](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng222/resources/furtherline-treatment-pdf-11131007009)
treatment.
Patients should be given a choice between stopping or continuing the treatment. An agreement
should be achieved with well-informed risks and benefits.
Discuss with patients that increased chance of relapse can happen in patients with:

  - History of recurrent depression episodes

  - History of incomplete response to previous treatment

  - Unhelpful coping styles (avoidance, rumination)

  - Chronic mental or physical health

  - Other contributing factors such as isolation, unemployment, poverty, relationship issues.

Discuss the risk of continuing the medicine long-term leading to difficulty in stopping, sexual
dysfunction or increased chance of bleeding.
If the patient is at high risk of relapse, but wishes to stop the pharmacological treatment, other first
line treatment such as psychological support should be offered via [Talking Therapies.](https://www.sheffieldtalkingtherapies.nhs.uk/)


**8. REFERRING TO SPECIALIST SERVICES**


Refer patients with more severe depression or chronic depressive symptoms to specialist mental
health services for multi-disciplinary approach when:

  - Their depression impairs personal and social functioning **and**

  - They have not benefitted from previous treatments and **either**
Have multiple problems e.g., unemployment, financial issues, poor living arrangements **or**
Have significant co-existing mental and physical health problems.

Multidisciplinary approach between patient, GP and specialist mental health practitioner should
establish a care plan for patient’s treatment and support with regular progress assessments.
