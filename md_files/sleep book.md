**QUALIFYING STATEMENTS**


The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) guidelines are based on
the best information available at the time of publication. The guidelines are designed to provide information
and assist decision making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed
as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management.


This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological
evidence. Developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical
relationships between various care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the
evidence and the strength of the recommendation.


Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when providers consider the needs of individual
patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Therefore, every
health care professional using these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying
them in the setting of any particular clinical situation with a patient-centered approach.


These guidelines are not intended to represent VA or DOD policies. Further, inclusion of
recommendations for specific testing, therapeutic interventions, or both within these guidelines does not
guarantee coverage of civilian sector care.

**Introduction**


The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) Evidence-Based
Practice Work Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to
advise the Health Executive Committee (HEC) “…on the use of clinical and epidemiological
evidence to improve the health of the population…” across the Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) and Military Health System (MHS), by facilitating the development of clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) for the VA and DOD populations.(1) This CPG is intended to provide
healthcare providers with a framework by which to evaluate, treat, and manage the individual
needs and preferences of patients with sleep disorders, specifically chronic insomnia disorder
and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), thereby leading to improved clinical outcomes.


An effort to create the Chronic Insomnia Disorder and OSA CPG was initiated in 2018. The
Chronic Insomnia Disorder and OSA CPG includes objective, evidence-based information on the
management of selected sleep disorders (chronic insomnia disorder and OSA). It is intended to
assist healthcare providers in all aspects of patient care, including, but not limited to, screening,
assessment, treatment, and follow-up. The system-wide goal of evidence-based guidelines is to
improve patient health and well-being by guiding health providers who are taking care of patients
with chronic insomnia disorder and/or OSA along management pathways that are supported by
evidence. The expected outcome of the successful implementation of this guideline is to:

  - Assess patient condition and determine, in collaboration with the patient, the best
treatment method(s)

  - Optimize patient health outcomes and improve quality of life

  - Minimize preventable complications and morbidity


  - Emphasize the use of patient-centered care (PCC)


**Recommendations**


The following recommendations were made using a systematic approach considering four
domains as per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) approach. These domains include confidence in the quality of the evidence, balance of
desirable and undesirable outcomes (i.e., benefits and harms), patient or provider values and
preferences, and other implications, as appropriate (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability).
GRADE is detailed in the full text Chronic Insomnia Disorder and OSA CPG in the Methods
section and Appendix A.

**Algorithm**


This algorithm is designed to inform providers of the recommended interventions and
appropriate timing of each of the interventions for patients with chronic insomnia disorder and/or
OSA. The interventions included in the algorithm are paired with the corresponding
recommendation in the VA/DOD CPG for the Management of Chronic Insomnia Disorder and
OSA. The use of the algorithm format to represent patient management was chosen based on
the understanding that such a format may promote more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic
decision making and has the potential to change patterns of resource use. Although the Work
Group recognizes that not all clinical practices are linear, the simplified linear approach depicted
through the algorithm and its format allows the provider to assess the critical information needed
at the major decision points in the clinical process. It includes:

  - An ordered sequence of steps of care

  - Recommended observations and examinations

  - Decisions to be considered

  - Actions to be taken


For each VA/DOD CPG, there is a corresponding clinical algorithm that is depicted by a step-bystep decision tree. Standardized symbols are used to display each step in the algorithm, and
arrows connect the numbered boxes indicating the order in which the steps should be followed.
(2)Sidebars 1-9 provide more detailed information to assist in defining and interpreting elements
in the boxes.

Rounded rectangles represent a clinical state or condition


Hexagons represent a decision point in the guideline, formulated as a question that can
be answered Yes or No


Rectangles represent an action in the process of care

factors that negatively impact sleep including light/noise exposure, eating/drinking near bedtime and
at night, caffeine/nicotine/alcohol use **(See Recommendation 7 in the full CPG)**

   - Cognitive Restructuring (CBT-I only): Addresses cognitive arousal (busy or racing mind) and
inaccurate sleep-related thoughts by challenging unhelpful thoughts and beliefs about sleep
Conditions requiring adaptations or delay of CBT-I/BBT-I:

   - Medically unstable (delay)

   - Active alcohol or drug use disorder (delay)

   - Excessive daytime sleepiness (adapt/delay)

   - Nighttime fall risk or inability to transfer in/out of bed (adapt)

2. Tired, fatigue, sleepy in daytime
3. Observed to stop breathing
4. Hypertension
High risk of OSA: greater than ≥2 items are answered “yes”
Low risk of OSA: less than <2 items are answered “yes”

STOP questionnaire should not replace clinical judgment; clinical assessment should include BMI >30
kg/m2, age >50, menopausal status, neck circumference, family history, and crowded oropharynx

`o` Advanced primary neurological conditions

`o` Medication related (opioid, sedative and hypnotics)

`o` Advanced respiratory comorbidities.

  - Stroke
2. Patients with significant sleep disruption (e.g. due to chronic insomnia disorder)
3. Physical, sensory and cognitive impairment
4. Chain of custody concerns
5. Low pretest probability for obstructive sleep apnea

**Sidebar 9: Treatment of OSA**


1. Prescribe PAP as first line therapy for patient with severe OSA (i.e., AHI >30 events per hour)
2. Prescribe PAP or MAD for other OSA severity (i.e., AHI 5 to <30 events per hour), based on clinical

evaluation, comorbidities, and patient preference.
3. Offer educational, behavioral therapy, and supportive interventions to improve PAP adoption and use

  - Consider a two-week course of eszopiclone to improve PAP adoption

  - Consider referral to behavioral sleep medicine provider to enhance PAP adoption and use
4. Encourage weight loss and a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program in patients with OSA who are

overweight or obese.
5. Refer patients for follow up to a sleep medicine specialist:

  - Who do not adopt/use PAP and/or MAD therapy

  - With persistent symptoms despite adequate therapy

**Scope of the CPG**


Ideally, any patient in the healthcare system should have access to the interventions that are
recommended in this guideline regardless of the setting and after taking into consideration the
patient’s specific circumstances.


Guideline recommendations are intended to be patient centered. Thus, treatment and care
should consider a patient’s needs and preferences. Good communication between healthcare
professionals and the patient is essential and should be supported by evidence-based
information tailored to the patient’s needs. An empathetic and non-judgmental approach
facilitates discussions sensitive to gender, culture, ethnicity, and other differences. The
information that patients are provided about treatment, and care should be culturally appropriate
and available to people with limited literacy skills. It should also be accessible to people with
additional needs, such as physical, sensory, or learning disabilities. Family involvement should
be considered, if appropriate.


This CPG is intended for use by VA, DOD, community providers, and others involved in the
health care team evaluating and managing adults with chronic insomnia disorder and/or
obstructive sleep apnea. The patient population of interest for this CPG is adult patients with
chronic insomnia disorder and/or obstructive sleep apnea who may receive care in the VA or
DOD health care delivery systems, or VA and DOD adult beneficiaries who receive care from
community-based providers. Recommendations in this CPG are applicable for any adult
patients of VA or DOD, inclusive of all care locations (VA, DOD, or community-based care).


**Methods**


The methodology used in developing the 2025 CPG follows the _Guideline for Guidelines_, an
internal document of the VA and DOD EBPWG that was updated in July 2019 that outlines
procedures for developing and submitting VA/DOD CPGs. (3) The _Guideline for Guidelines_ can
be downloaded from [http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp. This CPG also aligns with](http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp)
the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) principles of trustworthy CPGs (e.g., explanation of
evidence quality and strength, the management of potential conflicts of interest (COI)(4),
interdisciplinary stakeholder involvement, use of SR and external review)(5) This CPG also
aligns with the National Academy of Medicine’s (NAM) principles of trustworthy CPGs (e.g.,
explanation of evidence quality and strength, the management of potential conflicts of
interest(4), interdisciplinary stakeholder involvement, use of SR and external review)(5)
Appendix A of the full CPG provides a detailed description of the CPG development
methodology.


The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence-based
clinical practice recommendations and writing and publishing a guideline document to be used
by providers within the VA/DOD healthcare systems as well as those within the community who
treat military personnel or Veterans. Specifically, the Champions and Work Group members for
this guideline were responsible for identifying the key questions (KQs) of the most clinical
relevance, importance, and interest for the management of patients with chronic insomnia
disorder and/or OSA. The Champions and the Work Group also provided direction on inclusion
and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and assessed the level and quality of the evidence.
In addition, the Champions assisted in:

  - Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group


Page 15 of 27


_VA/DOD CPG for the Management of Chronic Insomnia Disorder and Obstructive Sleep Apnea – Provider Summary_
~~_fS_~~ ~~_S_~~

  - Directing and coordinating the Work Group

  - Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes


The VA Evidence Based Practice, Office of Quality and Patient Safety, in collaboration with
the Clinical Quality Improvement Program, DHA, identified the following four providers to
serve as Champions (i.e., leaders) of this CPG’s Work Group: Amir Sharafkhaneh, MD, and
Christi Ulmer, PhD, CBSM, DBSM, from VA; and Matthew Brock, MD, FAASM, and Vincent
Capaldi, ScM, MD, DFAPA, FACP, FAASM, from DOD.


The Sigma Team, including Sigma Health Consulting and Duty First Consulting was contracted
by the VA and DOD to support the development of this CPG and conduct the evidence review.
The first conference call was held in December 2023, with participation from the contracting
officer’s representative (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, the DOD
Office of Evidence Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, participants discussed
the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project
timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which to
base a systematic review (SR) about the management of patients with chronic insomnia disorder
and/or OSA. The group also identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise
important and relevant to the management of chronic insomnia disorder and/or OSA, from which
Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included:
internal medicine, sleep medicine, neurology, psychiatry, pulmonology, dental, psychology,
mental/behavioral health counseling, and otolaryngology.


The guideline development process for the 2025 CPG consisted of the following steps:


1. Determining the scope of the CPG;


2. Crafting clinically relevant KQs to guide the systematic evidence review;


3. Identifying discussion topics for the Patient Focus Group and considering the patient

perspective;


4. Providing direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic evidence

review and the assessment of the level and quality of evidence;


5. Developing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations, including determining

the strength and category of each recommendation; and


6. Drafting and submitting a final CPG on the management of chronic insomnia disorder

and/or OSA to the VA/DOD EBPWG


_**Grading Recommendations**_


The Work Group used the GRADE approach to craft each recommendation and determine its
strength. Per the GRADE approach, recommendations must be evidence based and cannot be
made based on expert opinion alone. The GRADE approach uses the following four domains to
inform the strength of each recommendation (6)


  - Confidence in the quality of the evidence

  - Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes

  - Patient or provider values and preferences

  - Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.,


`o` Resource use

Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each
recommendation (Strong or Weak). The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent
to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its
undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which incorporates the four
domains.(7) A Strong recommendation generally indicates High or Moderate confidence in the
quality of the available evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and
harms of an intervention, similar patient values and preferences, and understood influence of
other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility).


In some instances, insufficient evidence exists on which to base a recommendation for or
against a particular therapy, preventive measure, or other intervention. For example, the
systematic evidence review might have found little or no relevant evidence, inconclusive
evidence, or conflicting evidence for the intervention. The way this finding is expressed in the
CPG might vary. In such instances, the Work Group might include among its set of
recommendations a statement of insufficient evidence for an intervention that might be in
common practice although it is unsupported by clinical evidence and particularly if other risks of
continuing its use might exist (e.g., high opportunity cost, misallocation of resources). In other
cases, the Work Group might decide to exclude this type of statement about intervention. For
example, the Work Group might remain silent where an absence of evidence occurs for a rarely
used intervention. In other cases, an intervention might have a favorable balance of benefits
and harms but might be a standard of care for which no recent evidence has been generated.


Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum:

  - Strong for (or “We recommend offering this option …”)

  - Weak for (or “We suggest offering this option …”)

  - No recommendation for or against (or “There is insufficient evidence …”)

  - Weak against (or “We suggest not offering this option …”)

  - Strong against (or “We recommend against offering this option …”)


The grade of each recommendation made in the 2025 CPG can be found in the section on
Recommendations. Additional information regarding the use of the GRADE system can be found
in Appendix A in the full Chronic Insomnia Disorder and OSA CPG.

~~_fS_~~ ~~_S_~~


**Patient-Centered Care**


Intended to consider patient needs and preferences, guideline recommendations represent a
whole/holistic health approach to care that is patient-centered, culturally appropriate, and
available to people with limited literacy skills and physical, sensory, or learning disabilities.
VA/DOD CPGs encourage providers to use a patient-centered, whole/holistic health approach
(i.e., individualized treatment based on patient needs, characteristics, and preferences). This
approach aims to treat the condition while also optimizing the individual’s overall health and
wellbeing.


Regardless of the care setting, all patients should have access to individualized evidence-based
care. Patient-centered care can decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in providers, and
improve treatment adherence.(8,9) A whole/holistic health approach
[(https://www.va.gov/wholehealth/) empowers and equips individuals to meet their personal](https://www.va.gov/wholehealth/)
health and wellbeing goals. Good communication is essential and should be supported by
evidence-based information tailored to each patient’s needs. An empathetic and non-judgmental
approach facilitates discussions sensitive to gender, culture, ethnicity, and other differences.


**Shared Decision Making**


This CPG encourages providers to practice shared decision making, a process in which
providers, patients, and patient care partners (e.g., family, friends, caregivers) consider clinical
evidence of benefits and risks as well as patient values and preferences to make decisions
regarding the patient’s treatment.(10) Shared decision making is emphasized in Crossing the
Quality Chasm, an Institute of Medicine (IOM), now NAM, report in 2001 (11) and is inherent
within the whole/holistic health approach. Providers must be adept at presenting information to
their patients regarding individual treatments, expected risks, expected outcomes, and levels or
settings of care or both, especially where patient heterogeneity in weighing risks and benefits
might exist. The VHA and DHA have embraced shared decision-making. Providers are
encouraged to use shared decision making to individualize treatment goals and plans based on
patient capabilities, needs, and preferences.


**Provider Guide to Sleep Education for Insomnia Disorder**


Primary care providers are encouraged to provide patient education that includes general
information on insomnia disorder, treatment goal setting, and an accurate description of
behaviorally based treatments. To effectively communicate with patients about chronic insomnia
disorder, providers are encouraged to become familiar with the 3 Ps Model of Insomnia (12) to
understand the process by which insomnia disorder develops and why chronic insomnia
disorder is driven less by what caused one’s insomnia symptoms, but rather by the strategies
enacted to cope with insomnia symptoms. For patients who have already initiated CBT-I and
BBT-I treatments, primary care providers are encouraged to inquire about their ability to adhere to
the intervention components by identifying and helping patients’ problem-solve to overcome any
barriers to continuing with their plan of care. Examples of these provide education and support
conversations and activities are provided in the following sections.


_**A. General Information on Insomnia Disorder**_


“I’m glad you let me know about the sleep problems you’ve been having. From all that you’ve told
me; it sounds like you are suffering from insomnia disorder. Insomnia disorder can be a difficult


Page 20 of 27


_VA/DOD CPG for the Management of Chronic Insomnia Disorder and Obstructive Sleep Apnea – Provider Summary_
~~_fS_~~ ~~_S_~~

experience.While it can impact how you feel during the day, your mood and concentration, your
general health, and your enjoyment of activities, it doesn’t have to. There are treatments that are
effective.”


“Insomnia symptoms are usually first brought on because of stressful life events, such as military
training, deployment, trauma, emotional distress, or illness. During that stressful period, it is
understandable that your habits may change to cope with not getting enough sleep. During this
time, even thoughts and beliefs about sleep can change. But after the stressful period ends, your
sleep difficulties can persist due to the coping strategies used that were unhelpful. Ironically,
these unhelpful strategies turn into the cause of the ongoing insomnia. So, no matter what
caused your insomnia, the solution must address the unhelpful coping strategies that cause
your insomnia to persist.”


**If also treating a comorbid condition:** “I want to emphasize that insomnia is not merely a
symptom of another condition. Just as we are treating your ( _comorbid condition_ [ _e.g., pain,_
_depression_ ]), we should treat the insomnia as well.”


**If insomnia symptoms have been of short duration:** “Although you have not experienced
insomnia for a long time, the strategies you have adopted to cope with insomnia can promote a
chronic problem if we don’t correct these unhelpful strategies. I’d like to get you started with a
behavioral treatment to avoid that happening if possible.”


_**B. Goals of Insomnia Treatment**_


“Not everyone will be able to achieve, or even needs, a solid eight hours of sleep every night.
Everyone is different and sleep patterns change as people age. That said, you’ve told me that
you are struggling with ( _e.g., falling asleep, staying asleep, feeling rested when you wake_ ), and
you’re concerned about how these issues are impacting you during the daytime. We can work
together to help you sleep better and feel better during the day. What do you most hope to
achieve with insomnia treatment? What would you like to change about your sleep?”


_**C. Describing CBT-I and BBT-I to Patients**_


“CBT-I and BBT-I are primarily behavioral treatments for insomnia. There is good evidence that
these are the treatments of choice for people with insomnia that has lasted a few months or
longer. For example, they are more effective than if I just gave you some sleep strategies to
help your sleep which we call ‘sleep hygiene.’ Also, the effects of CBT-I and BBT-I are longer
lasting than if we treated insomnia with sleep medication, and these behavioral treatments do
not have the risk of medication interactions and side effects. I also want you to know that, in the
short run, sleep-inducing medications are less effective than behavioral therapies for chronic
insomnia. In the long run, sleep medications seem to be even less effective than behavioral
therapies, suggesting that behavioral therapies may address the underlying cause of chronic
insomnia.”


“In addition to including the sleep hygiene education I mentioned, CBT-I and BBT-I use multiple
techniques to target factors that maintain insomnia, and they provide you with skills that will
help you to regulate when you are asleep and awake. For example, a technique called ‘stimulus
control’ will help make the bed and the bedroom stronger cues for your brain to know that it is
time to be asleep. Another technique will help you figure out how much time you should spend
in bed to sleep well. You may also learn skills to help you relax at bedtime and techniques to
address thoughts and beliefs that interfere with your sleep. The provider will work with you to

~~_fS_~~ ~~_S_~~

create an individualized plan to best suit your needs. What questions do you have about this?
Could I set you up with an initial appointment (or provide a referral) to learn more about it?”


_**D. Examples of Supporting Self-management Goals Related to the Stimulus**_

_**Control and Sleep Restriction Components of CBT-I/BBT-I**_


**Associating bed with sleep** : “Many patients who have trouble sleeping spend a lot of time in
bed hoping they fall asleep. Over time, their minds and bodies end up associating the bed with
wakefulness rather than asleep. What sorts of things has (name of CBT-I or BBT-I provider)
discussed with you to help you to strengthen the association between your bed and sleep? Has
this been difficult for you?” ( _Note: Alert the CBT-I or BBT-I provider if the patient is unsure of how_
_they are approaching this_ .)


**Keeping a schedule** : “I saw that Dr. ( _name of CBT-I or BBT-I provider_ ) has talked with you about
an earlier bedtime and when to get out of bed each day. It is important to stick to that schedule.
How has this been for you? Some patients tell me it is a challenge. ( _Note: Alert the CBT-I or BBT-_
_I provider if the patient is unable to stick to their prescribed sleep schedule so adjustments can_
_be made_ .) Please be sure to complete your sleep diary as recommended by your healthcare
provider, to allow them to get a more accurate estimate of your sleep schedule

**Provider Guide to Sleep Education for Obstructive Sleep Apnea**

Primary care providers are encouraged to provide patient education that includes general
information on OSA, an accurate description of PAP and/or MAD therapy and setting treatment
goals. In addition, primary care providers are encouraged to support adherence to the patient’s
OSA therapy of choice by reviewing a PAP therapy download in patients using either autoadjusting PAP or continuous (fixed pressure) PAP, or in the case of patients using MAD
therapy, inquiring about their usage of the device. Primary care providers should assess for
any treatment-related side effects, identify barriers to adherence, and determine if the patient’s
presenting symptoms, specifically including sleepiness, are adequately addressed. Examples
are provided in the following sections.


_**A. General Information on Obstructive Sleep Apnea**_


“Obstructive sleep apnea is a very common and serious sleep disorder, which affects many
military personnel and Veterans. Snoring is one common symptom of sleep apnea but not all
patients with sleep apnea snore. Other common sleep apnea symptoms include sleepiness,
morning headaches, using the bathroom frequently at night, a dry sore mouth, sleep
fragmentation, and daytime fatigue. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you may
have sleep apnea.”


“What defines sleep apnea are pauses in breathing – either a partial pause (hypopnea) or
complete absence of breathing (apnea) – that occur while an individual is sleeping. During these
periods of little to no breathing, oxygen levels can decrease (hypoxia) and carbon dioxide levels
can increase (hypercapnia). Many of the serious medical consequences, such as hypertension,
heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and death, result from the frequent episodes of hypoxia.
Frequent awakenings during the night also lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and increased
risk for motor vehicle accidents. We will need to obtain a sleep study to confirm this diagnosis.
There are effective treatments for sleep apnea.”


_**B. Diagnosing Sleep Apnea: Sleep Studies**_


“There are two options for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea: (1) a home sleep apnea test,
which is only used to confirm a highly suspected case of obstructive sleep apnea, and (2) an
in-lab sleep study (polysomnography), which provides more comprehensive information. Both
studies measure your oxygen levels and the number of times per hour your breathing
decreases or stops, which is called the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). If you have sleep apnea
symptoms and your AHI is >5 events per hour, you have sleep apnea. If a home sleep apnea
test does not confirm a diagnosis of sleep apnea, then additional testing may be required.”


_**C. Describing Sleep Apnea Treatment to Patients**_


“The primary and most efficacious treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is positive airway
pressure (PAP) therapy. PAP is gentle air pressure that is delivered by a small bedside
machine connected to a mask that you wear while sleeping. There are 2 types of PAP: (1) an
auto-adjusting PAP (APAP), which automatically adjusts how much pressure is delivered to
keep your airway open, or (2) a continuous PAP (CPAP), which delivers one set pressure (i.e.,
it does not vary over time). You should use PAP whenever you sleep, including naps, and for
the longest possible duration. Longer use of PAP is better for your sleep and overall health. “

Page 23 of 27


_VA/DOD CPG for the Management of Chronic Insomnia Disorder and Obstructive Sleep Apnea – Provider Summary_
~~_fS_~~ ~~_S_~~

“For a variety of reasons, some patients may choose other treatments for obstructive sleep
apnea. One alternative is a mandibular advancement device (MAD). Depending on your teeth
and severity of sleep apnea, this may be a reasonable treatment. This device works by moving
your lower jaw forward to open your airway and maintaining it in this position while you wear it
during sleep. In order to obtain a MAD, you will need to see a dentist who is experienced in
making these devices."


“There are other less common medical devices and surgeries that can be considered for
treatment of your sleep apnea. However, you will need to speak with a sleep specialist to
determine the appropriateness of these therapies.”


_**D. Other Areas that Can Make Sleep Apnea Better or Worse**_


“Overall, men have a higher prevalence of sleep apnea than women. In women, postmenopausal status increases their risk of having sleep apnea. Weight loss can improve sleep
apnea while weight gain can make sleep apnea worse. Avoiding sleep on your back can
improve sleep apnea in some patients as sleeping on your back typically makes sleep apnea
worse. Using certain substances and medications (i.e., alcohol, opioids/pain medications,
sleeping medications) can make sleep apnea worse.”


_**E. Addressing Sleepiness**_


“Sleepiness is one of the primary symptoms of sleep apnea. Patients with untreated sleep
apnea are at increased risk of motor vehicle crashes and mistakes on duty or at work. If you
are sleepy, you should neither drive nor perform dangerous or critical tasks.”


_**F. Addressing Adherence to Positive Airway Pressure**_


The following are interventions that can help with PAP adherence:

  - Provide education that includes an overview of OSA and the patient’s treatment
modality


  - Use heated humidification to help with nasal dryness and congestion with PAP
usage


  - Ensure the appropriate mask choice, noting nasal masks are associated with higher
adherence


  - Investigate and address issues of high mask leak


  - Refer to cognitive behavioral therapies that address distorted views of sleep and
sleep apnea, promote positive associations with PAP, and enlist social support

  - Arrange close follow-up (at least at 4-weeks, if not sooner) after PAP initiation to
evaluate usage
