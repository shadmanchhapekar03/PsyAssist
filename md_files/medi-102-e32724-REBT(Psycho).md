**Abstract**
**Background:** Studies reporting the incidence of depression among medical students have been on the increase. This research
sought to determine whether rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) can be applied to help manage depression in Nigerian
undergraduate medical students.

**Methods:** A randomized pretest/posttest control group design was used in this study. Ninety medical students with depression
participated in the study and were assisted using the REBT depression manual. Using a mixed-model repeated measures analysis
of variance, the researchers examined the intervention data.

**Results:** The depressive symptoms and its associated irrational beliefs among medical students in the treatment arm were
significantly altered by REBT intervention at posttest and this positive outcome was sustained at follow-up in contrast to the
control arm.

**Conclusion:** REBT intervention significantly improves medical students’ ability to overcome depression and irrational beliefs.
Similar studies could be conducted in a variety of academic settings where these students can be found to expand the findings
of this study.

1. Introduction


The aspiration to study medicine at the university is often the
desire of many prospective students in developing regions.
They create a mental picture of themselves in white coats as
medical students and subsequently as physicians. However,
behind the white coats are young undergraduate students
battling psychological issues. [[1]] In a study carried out at
the Karolinska Institute Medical University, it was discovered that medical students had significantly higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than students in other fields,
at 12.9%. [[2]] The authors found that depression is linked to
several stressors linked to a lack of feedback, concerns about

future competence, an unwelcoming environment, and subpar teaching and learning techniques. [[2]] Using DSM-III criteria, it was discovered that major depression occurs among
medical students during the first 2 years of medical school. [[3,4]]
The Aga Khan University Anxiety and Depression Scale was
used in a cross-sectional study at Nishtar Medical College,
and the results showed a high prevalence of depression among
medical students in their first, second, third, fourth, and final
years: 45.86%, 52.58%, 47.14%, 28.75%, and 45.10%,
respectively. [[5,6]]
Curriculum administration and design are also known to be
among the main causes of depression in medical students. [[7,8]]

in the causes of depression among medical students. [[1]] It can
include a polygamous family environment or an excessive academic workload that falls short of expectations. [[1]] Medical students are also more likely to experience depression if they had
recently gone through a traumatic event. [[9]] In another study,
the researchers discovered significant differences in depression
rates among medical students, with female students experiencing depression at a higher rate. [[10]] Similar studies conducted on
medical students revealed that female medical students were
more sensitive to the causes of depression than their male
counterparts. [[2,11–13]]
In the last few decades, the cases of depression among
Nigerian medical students have been on the increase with a
prevalence rate of 23.3%. [[13]] The authors discovered that female
medical students preparing for their professional examination
throughout the study period had greater levels of depression. [[13]]
Several factors contribute to varying degrees of depression
among Nigerian medical students including frequent lecture
rescheduling, high failure rates in Bachelor of Medicine and
Bachelor of Surgery examinations, extensive distances from
hostels to learning areas, and limited dormitory accommodation. [[14]] More so, it was discovered that 4% of medical students
were predisposed to moderate to severe depression in another
Nigerian study, with gender and age not being substantially connected with depression. [[15]]
Years later, it was reported that male medical students were
more prone to depression, with a 51.9% prevalence rate. [[16]] The
authors also discovered that fifth-year medical students had the
largest proportion of depressed individuals (58.2%). However,
according to a recent Nigerian study, the frequency of depression among Nigerian medical students was 15.1%. [[17]] The study
also found that depression was more prevalent in female medical students under the age of 22, those at a lower level of study,
those with less social support, and those with a family history of
depression. [[17]] The primary goal of the present study is to investigate the effect of rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) on
depression among undergraduate medical students in Nigerian
universities. The researchers expect that REBT would be useful
in lowering depressive symptoms among the medical students.
Also, due to the significant link between clients’ irrational beliefs
and depressive symptoms, the researchers expects that the irrational beliefs associated with medical students’ depression will
be significantly reduced by REBT intervention at posttest and be
sustained at follow-up.


_1.1. Theory of REBT in the context of depression_

In REBT, irrational beliefs are considered to be substantial
contributors to emotional disturbances like depression. [[18]]
The primary objective of REBT is to improve the occurrence
of healthy and adaptable emotional and behavioral reactions
by teaching patients to think more logically when faced with


~~**Table 1**~~

**Phases** **Wk** **Sessions** **Structure**



hardship. [[19]] According to REBT, emotions and actions are not
largely brought about by external events; rather, an individual’s
beliefs about the events determine one’s emotional and behavioral responses. [[20]] According to REBT, there are 4 main categories of illogical beliefs that influence depression. These include
demandingness, self-downing, awfulizing, and low frustration
tolerance. [[21–23]] Demandingness is the irrational and unwavering insistence on things or people turning out the way the person wants them to. Awfulizing is the process of exaggerating a
situation’s negative effects to an extreme degree to portray an
already unfortunate event as terrible. Low frustration tolerance,
also referred to as “I-can’t-stand-it,” is the admission of struggle
accompanied by the assertion that the struggle is intolerable or
nearly insurmountable. Self-downing, also known as depreciation, is the idea that someone generalizes based on their first
attempt and assigns value to themselves in accordance with the
outcome. [[23]]
The use of REBT techniques in treating psychological
problems, such as depression and post-traumatic depression, has been shown to have significant advantages in the
literature. [[24–27]] REBT intervention programs can shield students from developing more severe mental health symptoms
like major depressive disorders. [[28]] In a recent study on the
impact of REBT on depression management among students
with learning disabilities, it was discovered that participants’
depression levels were significantly lower after receiving
exposure to REBT during the posttest and follow-up than
they were for participants who did not receive such exposure. [[29]] The use of REBT for depression treatment cannot
be overstated in view of studies showing a significant relationship between irrationality and depressive symptoms. [[30–35]]
Literature also suggests that a hybrid model of learning may
be able to account for some of the cognitive and learning processes involved in the formation and maintenance of irrational beliefs and depression. [[32–35]]


2. Materials and method


_2.1. Area of the study_

This study took place in 3 public institutions in Nigeria’s
South-South region, in the states of Edo, Delta, and Akwa
Ibom in 2019. With a total population of 3,233,366 people,
Edo State is one of Nigeria’s states with the highest levels of
educational attainment. There are 4,112,445 people living in
Delta state, an oil and agricultural producing state in Nigeria
(men: 2,069,309; women: 2,043,136). The total land area of
Delta state is 16,842 square kilometers (6503 sq mi). With a
population of 5,482,200, Akwa Ibom State ranks as Nigeria’s
highest oil-producing state in terms of crude oil and natural gas
production. Currently, 7249 square kilometers of land make up
Akwa Ibom State.

_2.2. Design of the study_

A randomized pretest/posttest control group design was used in
this investigation.


_2.3. Sample and sampling technique_

For this group intervention study, 90 medical students (N) are
needed to maintain 80% power (medium effect size, d = .50;
ICC=−.05). [[36]] We divided N by the average number of members
in each group (m = 15) for the 2 research arms, and used a
2-tailed test with an _α_ level of .05. This yielded the total number of groups (G = 6) included in the study. With the use of
Saghaei randomization program, [[37]] group randomization produced 45 individuals for the intervention group and 45 people
for the control group (see Fig. 1). The students’ bio-data dataset
indicated that 53.3% were males while 46.7% were females.
In addition, it was revealed that 66.6% were within the ages
of 17 to 20, 27.7% were between the ages of 21 and 24, and
5.5% were between the ages of 25 and 28. Lastly, 60% of these
students were in their first year while 40% were in their second
year.


_2.4. Method for selecting participants and characteristics_

Ninety medical students with depression were the research participants. The participants were chosen from 3 Nigerian public
universities following written informed consent. Following a
random sample of first- and second-year medical Bachelor of
Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery students from each of the
chosen universities, the study was conducted.


_2.5. Measures_

The Zung Depression Inventory (ZDI) was used as a dependent
measure in this study to determine participants’ depression levels. [[38]] This 20-item self-reported questionnaire called the ZDI
has already been used to reliably screen for depression in several
settings. With a Cronbach _α_ of 0.79, the ZDI is judged to have
excellent psychometric qualities. [[3,39]] Responses are gathered
and given a score between 1 and 4 for each question, with a
total score between 20 and 80. A score of <50 is thought to indicate the absence of depression, whereas a score of >50 indicated
the presence of depression. [[38]]
The Beck Depression Inventory, version 2 (BDI-II) was used
as a further dependent measure in this study to gauge participants’ depression levels. [[40]] The goal of BDI-II was to uncover
potential depression symptoms that ZDI was unable to detect.
The BDI-II is a 21-item, self-administered questionnaire that
measures depression severity on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3.
The total score runs from 0 to 63, with scores between 0 and
13 being classified in the minimal range and 14 and 19 being
considered mild, 20 to 28 is considered moderate, and 29 to 63
is considered severe. [[40]]
The Irrational Beliefs Inventory (IBI), created by Koopmans et
al, was used as a supplementary dependent tool in this study. [[41]]
The IBI is a 50-item questionnaire that evaluates 5 types of
irrational beliefs: the need for approval (7 things), worry (12
items), rigidity (14 items), emotional irresponsibility (7 items),
and problem avoidance (10 items). Participants answered each
question using a 5-point Likert scale (1 being strongly disagreed,
and 5 being strongly agreed).


_2.6. Description of intervention manual_

The REBT depression manual served as the treatment plan for
the intervention group. The REBT depression manual uses the
rational-emotive and cognitive behavior therapy framework. [[42]]
This focuses on unreasonable notions such as demandingness,



self-deprecation, awfulizing, and a low tolerance for frustration.
In this study, medical students’ problematic beliefs were altered
using REBT approaches. This intervention comprises of 20 sessions of a 14-week program that spans 2 weeks of follow-up
meetings and 12 weeks of active therapy. Fifty minutes were
allotted for each session.


_2.7. Control condition_

The researchers administered a placebo program to the members of the control group. Some therapists frequently employ
the placebo program in their everyday work. A treatment guidebook for psychological wellbeing was modified by the researchers and used as the placebo manual. For the same number of
weeks as the REBT intervention, the control program consisted
of 20 sessions, each lasting 50 minutes. It worked as a placebo
to occupy the members of the control group.


_2.8. The therapists_

Six psychologists, who were trained in cognitive behavioral
approaches, including cognitive behavior therapy and REBT,
provided the treatments. Each of them had a PhD in psychology,
and they ranged in age from 35 to 50.


_2.9. Integrity check_

Six external assessors were tasked with monitoring the application of the REBT therapy and the control condition, respectively,
to ensure that the therapists followed the manuals methodically.
The assessors kept track of the participants’ attendance and
oversaw each session throughout the treatment program.


_2.10. Method of data analysis_

SPSS version 22 and JASP statistical tools were used for the
analyses. Using a mixed-model repeated measures analysis of
variance, the researchers examined the intervention data. The
pretest to posttest changes in the dependent variable is examined
in the repeated measures model’s Time × Group interaction to
see whether the intervention condition’s change is greater than
the control condition’s change. Time is modeled as a categorical
variable. [[44]] Eta squared was used to calculate the intervention
effect size ( _η_ [2] ). The internal consistency of datasets for medical students’ depression was tested using Cronbach _α_ reliability
estimate.
The internal consistency coefficients of .644, .891, and .946
were established for ZDI, BDI–II, and IBI instruments. The reliability coefficients of these instruments were >0.6, indicating
that the instruments were reliable. Furthermore, the temporary
stability of the dataset was established using Pearson product
moment correlation. The temporary stability coefficients of
.739, .788, and .996 were computed for ZDI, BDI–II, and IBI
instruments respectively. The high temporary stability coefficients show that the instruments are stable. This denotes a violation of equality of variance. The depression dataset as measured
by ZDI was subjected to a sphericity test. The sphericity coefficient was not significant, [ _x_ [2] (2) = 0.135, _P_ = .225] denoting
that the assumption of sphericity was not violated. Furthermore,
there was a violation of the sphericity assumption in BDI–II and
IBI datasets [ _x_ [2] (2) = 10.377, _P_ = .006] and [ _x_ [2] (2) = 263.942, _P_
< .001], hence, Greenhouse–Geisser was applied.


3. Results

Pretest mean ratings of depression among medical students
are shown in Table 2 and were essentially the same for control and treatment arms. The mean rating of medical students

significantly changed following the intervention (F [1, 87] =
257.533; _P_ < .001, _η_ [2] = 0.253). Concerning time, there was a
significant difference (F [2, 86] = 175.826; _P_ ≤ .001, _η_ [2] = 0.328).
And the interaction between intervention and time was significant (F[2, 86] = 91.790; _P_ < .001, _η_ [2] = 0.171). Holm post hoc
analysis was conducted. Concerning intervention, there was a



difference in mean ratings of the treatment and control group
(mean difference = −9.466, standard error = 0.590; _P_ < .001).
Based on time, significant differences existed between pretest
and posttest (mean difference = 8.591, standard error = 0.704; _P_
< .001), pretest and follow-up (mean difference = 12.978, standard error = 0.704; _P_ < .001) and posttest and follow-up (mean

difference = 4.387, standard error = 0.704; _P_ < .001). Hence,
the REBT intervention enhanced and sustained the reduction
of depression among medical students as measured by the ZDI
instrument.
In Table 3, the mean ratings of depression as measured by the
BDI-II instrument among medical students at pretest were significantly same for participants in control and treatment arms.
After the intervention, there was a significant difference in the
mean ratings of medical students in both groups (F [1, 87] =
217.143; _P_ < .001, _η_ [2] = 0.252). Concerning time, there was a
significant difference (F [2, 86] = 178.204; _P_ < .001, _η_ [2] = 0.305).
And the interaction between intervention and time was significant (F [2, 86] = 111.294; _P_ < .001, _η_ [2] = .190). Holm post hoc
test was conducted. Based on intervention, there was a difference in mean ratings of the treatment and control group (mean
difference = −14.319, standard error = 0.972; _P_ < .001). Based
on time, significant differences existed between pretest and
posttest (mean difference = 12.367, standard error = 1.021; _P_
< .001), pretest and follow-up (mean difference = 18.978, standard error = 1.021; _P_ < .001) and posttest and follow-up (mean
difference = 6.611, standard error = 1.021; _P_ < .001). Hence,
the REBT intervention enhanced and sustained the reduction of
depression among medical students as measured by the BDI-II
instrument.
Table 4 shows that the mean scores of medical students
exposed to treatment and control conditions did not significantly differ at pretest according to the IBI. After the intervention, there was a significant difference in the mean ratings of
medical students in both groups (F [1, 87] = 179.748; _P_ < .001,
_η_ [2] = 0.334). Concerning time, there was a significant difference
(F [2, 86] = 112.576; _P_ < .001, _η_ [2] = 0.145). And the interaction between intervention and time was significant (F [2, 86]
= 190.197; _P_ < .001, _η_ [2] = 0.244). Holm post hoc test was conducted. Based on intervention, there was a difference in mean
ratings of the treatment and control group (mean difference =
−44.193, standard error = 3.296; _P_ < .001). Based on time, significant differences existed between pretest and posttest (mean
difference = 30.711, standard error = 2.373; _P_ < .001), pretest
and follow-up (mean difference = 30.956, standard error =
2.373; _P_ < .001) but not between posttest and follow-up (mean
difference = 0.244, standard error = 2.373; _P_ = .918). Hence,
the REBT intervention enhanced and sustained the reduction
of irrational beliefs among medical students as measured by the
IBI instrument.


4. Discussion

The study found that REBT significantly enabled medical students to manage depression and overcome associated irrational beliefs. This finding is in line with a previous study that
participants’ depressive symptoms significantly reduced during
posttest and follow-up using REBT intervention in a sample
of 48 Nigerian students. [[30]] Also, in a clinical control trial conducted among a sample of 88 depressed Romanian youths, it
was found that significant decreases in self-reported depression

occurred during the post-treatment under REBT conditions. [[45]]
Similar to this, using a group randomized controlled trial
design, it was discovered that the REBT group significantly
reduced their depression scores both at the post-treatment
and follow-up evaluations when compared to the no-intervention control group in a sample of 65 depressed undergraduate
students. [[26]] Following a REBT therapy intervention, a significant decrease in participants’ illogical beliefs was observed
by another study, [[46]] which is consistent with the findings of
the current study. Another study reported that participants’
irrational beliefs decreased significantly following a treatment intervention that used REBT. [[47]] It is also interesting to
mention that there have been a number of previous studies
that have demonstrated the clinical importance of REBT in
reducing irrational beliefs and fostering rational beliefs among
participants, and these studies are consistent with the current
study. [[48–50]]
There are some other studies whose findings support our
current results. For instance, in a quasi-experimental study
using the REBT group for depression treatment among 60
depressed Malaysian teenagers, the authors found out that
REBT structured counseling group was effective in bringing down the psychological variables of depression with no
gender difference. [[51]] Additionally, a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study reported that REBT was effective in lowering depression in patients with hypertension during the
posttest and follow-up period. [[52]] In another previous study
among 23 education undergraduates with the major depressive disorder at a Nigerian university, the authors found that
REBT was successful in lowering depression ratings among
the students. [[53]] More so, some researchers conducted a
study to determine the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of
REBT in treating depression among a Romanian sample of
170 depressed clients. [[54]] The researchers discovered that the
depressed patients’ average depression scores fell from 31.1
prior to therapy to 9.7 after REBT was finished. [[54]] Another
quasi-experimental study that included 45 divorced women in
Iran who were randomly assigned to experimental and control
groups by convenience sampling revealed a significant difference between the mean depression scores of the experimental
and control groups, indicating that REBT may help divorced

women with their depression and irrational beliefs. [[55,56]] A pretest-posttest approach was employed to investigate the efficacy of REBT on depressed female Iranian adolescents and the
results were positive [[57]] and in line with the present research
findings.


_4.1. Study limitations and implications_

One of study’s limitations is that it only included undergraduate
medical students from 3 public institutions in Nigeria’s southsouth region; hence, medical students from private universities
and other public universities were not considered. As such, the
results should be applied with caution given its limited scope.
Another limitation is the exclusive use of quantitative tools to
address depression and irrationality in medical students which
we think are unable to offer deep insights into the lived experiences of these students. Therefore, the use of qualitative tools
to examine depression and irrational beliefs in medical students
is recommended in future studies in order to provide greater
understanding of these psychological concerns from the perspective of these students and further influence psychological
treatment options that could be employed in future research.
One implication of this study is that in order to improve medical students’ mental health, university counseling centers must
work towards providing equitable mental health services to
undergraduate students. They also need to implement therapeutic innovations in their mental health counseling services which
would include REBT interventions. To lower the prevalence of
irrational views among medical students, therapists must continue to emphasize the development of logical beliefs amongst
these students. This is because eliminating irrational beliefs is
crucial for lowering depressed symptoms in medical students
and improving their psychological well-being.


5. Conclusion

We applied the REBT intervention among university undergraduate medical students to examine whether this intervention helps
to alleviate depressive symptoms and related irrational beliefs
in these students. The study showed that REBT intervention is
significantly effective in enabling medical students to manage
depression at post-treatment and this outcome was sustained
at follow-up. The irrational beliefs associated with medical students’ depression were significantly altered by REBT at posttest
and follow-up. Therefore, similar studies should be conducted
in a variety of academic settings in which these students are
found, to expand the findings of this study.
