This guide aims to help you to:






 - sadness


 - anxiety


 - feeling tearful


It can be hard to understand the emotions you're experiencing, and it can feel


overwhelming.


**Grief and your thoughts**


You might have thoughts like this:


 - “I should have done more.”


 - “I should have said that when they were alive.”


 - “I shouldn’t have said that.”


 - “It’s my fault.”


 - “It’s the doctor’s fault” – sometimes people who are grieving blame someone


or something else for the loss.


 - “If things had been different they’d still be alive.”


 - “Why am I still alive when they’re dead?”


 - “What have I done to deserve this?”


You may also think about the future you might have had with the person, and feel


regret and sadness about lost opportunities to spend time with them.


**How grief can affect what you do**


When you’re grieving, you might:


 - avoid going to places that remind you of your loved one, or find it very difficult


to be in those places


 - become withdrawn, not wanting to go out or see or talk to people


 - avoid talking about your loved one


 - try to avoid thinking about your loved one


**How grief can affect relationships with other people**


Grief can have a big effect on how you interact with and feel about other people in


your life.


 - you might become more irritable and grumpy, and find yourself being rude or


offhand with people, or ‘snapping’ at loved ones


 - you might struggle to cope when people say insensitive things, like “they had


a good life,” or “at least they’re not suffering anymore”


 - you might feel angry with other people and have trouble keeping in mind that


most people are trying to make you feel better, even if they say the wrong


thing


 - you might find it too difficult to speak to people at times


 - people who don’t know you’ve been through a loss might say things that upset


you – it can be hard to remember that they don’t know your circumstances,


and they aren’t trying to hurt you


 - when you’re grieving your feelings can be very ‘raw’ – it can be much easier


for people to accidentally hurt you


Grief can put a strain on existing relationships, especially if they were difficult to


begin with or those people are also grieving the same loss in their own way. There’s


more information on managing relationships with people close to you later on in the


guide.


complete it all at once. The planner can be quite flexible – it’s okay for plans to


change. Remember to set aside some time to relax and unwind – don’t feel like you


have to fill every hour of the day.


You'll find a planner to fill out below. If you save this file after filling out the boxes,


you’ll be able to go back and review the planner later.


Please note: if you use an iPhone, the only way to edit the planner is by using a PDF


app on your device.


## **Stay occupied**

While it’s important to work through grief, rather than try to ignore your feelings, it’s


helpful to focus on other things from time to time. After the initial activity of the


funeral and any legal matters, you might feel like there’s too much time on your


hands. Alternatively, you might feel like all your time is now spent taking care of


day-to-day tasks that were previously shared with your partner.


It might be some time before you feel ready for this, but taking time for yourself is


very helpful when it comes to healing from grief – it helps you to move into this next


phase of your life with a sense of purpose. If you can, look into new hobbies or


activities, or try spending more time with friends. Even going to the cinema or


spending an hour reading a book can be very helpful, and give your mind a rest from


the negative feelings and thoughts you’ve been coping with.


Filling out the planner above will help you stay occupied in a healthy way while still


leaving time to process your grief.

## **Reach out**


Many people worry about asking for help after the loss of a partner – they worry


about ‘being a bother’ and inconveniencing people. However, your loved ones will


likely want to help you, and it’s very reassuring to know someone you care about will


ask for help when needed.


Don’t be afraid to reach out to your friends, neighbours, and family and tell them


what you need, even if it’s just a chat. Suggesting to people how they could help you


could also be helpful for them, as it can be hard to know what to say or do when


someone close to you is dealing with a loss.


If you haven’t already got a mobile phone, it would be a good idea to get one and


trade numbers with family members so they can reach you at any time. It can also be


easier to text than call if you’re discussing difficult feelings.


# **12. Living with grief**

Learning to live with grief while moving forward with your life can be difficult, but


there are ways to care for yourself and make the next part of your grief journey


easier and less painful.

## **Significant dates**


After experiencing a bereavement, many people have difficulty coping with holidays,


birthdays, and the anniversary of their loved one’s death. This is particularly true for


the ‘firsts’ after someone has passed away – the first Christmas, for example, or the


first anniversary of your loss. Here are some ideas for helping you to get through the


difficult days:


**Honour your loved one**


It might be tempting to pretend everything is fine and “put on a brave face”, but you


will likely feel better if you take some time to acknowledge your feelings on


significant dates. Take some time to think about your loved one and how they would


have spent the day, and talk about them with the people around you. You may wish


to go to the grave or a memorial site and lay some flowers – this can be particularly


helpful on the anniversary of their passing.


**Decide how to celebrate, if you want to**


If your loss is recent, the thought of celebrating a holiday like Christmas or your


birthday can feel like too much. If so, it’s okay if you want to ‘cancel’ the day. Talk to


your family and decide together – you might decide to have a smaller celebration


with only those closest to you, for example. Or you might decide to have the same


type of celebration you usually do, but take some time to visit your loved one’s


grave. There’s really no right or wrong way to handle holidays, as long as everyone


is able to celebrate, and grieve, in their own way.


**Find ways to lift your mood**


On significant dates in particular, you might struggle with feelings of grief being


stronger than they have been in some time. The day can feel like a painful reminder


of your loss. While it’s important to acknowledge your feelings, it can also be helpful


to lean on sources of support and find ways of lifting your mood. This can include


planning to spend time with friends and family, arranging a session with your


therapist, or simply watching a movie or TV show that will make you laugh. If you


plan to do something like this ahead of time, it can make the day feel easier to cope


with.

## **Asking for help**


After losing someone close to you, it can be hard to reach out and tell people what


you need. The help you need can be in the form of emotional support, or it could be


practical things, like assistance with fixing something in your home. You might find it


helpful to make a list of the people that you feel comfortable with asking for help and


support, and keeping it close by. It can also be a good idea to think about what you


need before reaching out, and perhaps write it down.


Preparation can be very useful if you need help with matters related to work or


health. For example, if you need to request additional time off from work, read your


company’s policy on bereavement and compassionate leave beforehand and write


down what you’d like to say when making your request. If you’re asking your GP for


advice on bereavement services in your area, make a note of the kind of services


you think could help you the most.


Reaching out for help can feel difficult at first, but as you do it more often, you’ll find


it gets easier. Your loved ones will likely be glad that you feel able to reach out.

## **Remembering your loved one**


As you move forward in your grief journey, you could find comfort in remembering


your loved one and keeping their memory alive. There are a number of ways you


could do this, including:


## **Hobbies**

Hobbies can be very helpful, and make you feel productive. You might not be the


same person you were before the loss, but spending time on the activities you’re


passionate about will help you feel more comfortable with who you are now. If


there’s a hobby you’ve always wanted to try, search online for groups in your area


that will help you develop your new skill.

## **Socialising**


It can be difficult to reach out to friends and family members when you’re grieving.


As you move forward in your grief journey, it’s important to stay in touch with people.


If you haven’t been in contact with friends for some time, reach out. Keeping a


support network of friends and family around will help you as you work out what this


new phase of your life will look like.

## **Remember to relax**


Don’t feel you need to be busy all the time. It’s important to have a sense of purpose


and keep your mind and body active, but that doesn’t mean you need to be


constantly moving. It’s okay to rest and do nothing sometimes.


If you’re having difficulty working out how to spend your time, you can use the


planner available in sections 6, 7 and 9.

## **Alcohol and drugs**


Avoid drugs and alcohol, especially if you’re feeling low. People who have


experienced a bereavement can be vulnerable to problem alcohol and drug use,


and using substances won’t help you deal with the pain in the long term.
