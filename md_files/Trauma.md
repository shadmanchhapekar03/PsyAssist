### **Introduction**

Trauma is a widespread, harmful and costly public supports and intervention, people can overcome

status, race, ethnicity, geography or sexual orientation. diseases. [1,10,11]



It is an almost universal experience of people with
mental and substance use disorders. The need
to address trauma is increasingly viewed as an
important component of effective behavioral health
service delivery. Additionally, it has become evident
that addressing trauma requires a multi-pronged,
multi-agency public health approach inclusive of
public education and awareness, prevention and
early identification, and effective trauma-specific
assessment and treatment. _**In order to maximize the**_

_**in an organizational or community context that is**_

The effects of traumatic events place a heavy
burden on individuals, families and communities and
create challenges for public institutions and service
systems. Although many people who experience
a traumatic event will go on with their lives without
lasting negative effects, others will have more
difficulty and experience traumatic stress reactions.
Emerging research has documented the relationships
among exposure to traumatic events, impaired
neurodevelopmental and immune systems responses
and subsequent health risk behaviors resulting in
chronic physical or behavioral health disorders. [1,2,3,4,5]

Research has also indicated that with appropriate



Individuals with experiences of trauma are found
in multiple service sectors, not just in behavioral
health. Studies of people in the juvenile and criminal
justice system reveal high rates of mental and
substance use disorders and personal histories of
trauma. [12,13] Children and families in the child welfare
system similarly experience high rates of trauma and
associated behavioral health problems. [5,14] Young
people bring their experiences of trauma into the
school systems, often interfering with their school
success. And many patients in primary care similarly
have significant trauma histories which has an impact
on their health and their responsiveness to health
interventions. [15,16,17]


In addition, the public institutions and service systems
that are intended to provide services and supports
to individuals are often themselves trauma-inducing.
The use of coercive practices, such as seclusion and
restraints, in the behavioral health system; the abrupt
removal of a child from an abusing family in the child
welfare system; the use of invasive procedures in the
medical system; the harsh disciplinary practices in
educational/school systems; or intimidating practices
in the criminal justice system can be re-traumatizing
for individuals who already enter these systems
with significant histories of trauma. These program
or system practices and policies often interfere with
achieving the desired outcomes in these systems.

### **Purpose and Approach: Developing a Framework for Trauma** **and a Trauma-Informed Approach**


**PURPOSE**



The purpose of this paper is to develop a working
concept of trauma and a trauma-informed approach
and to develop a shared understanding of these
concepts that would be acceptable and appropriate
across an array of service systems and stakeholder
groups. SAMHSA puts forth a framework for the
behavioral health specialty sectors, that can be
adapted to other sectors such as child welfare,
education, criminal and juvenile justice, primary
health care, the military and other settings that have
the potential to ease or exacerbate an individual’s
capacity to cope with traumatic experiences. In
fact, many people with behavioral health problems
receive treatment and services in these non-specialty
behavioral health systems. SAMHSA intends this



framework be relevant to its federal partners and
their state and local system counterparts and to
practitioners, researchers, and trauma survivors,
families and communities. The desired goal is to build
a framework that helps systems “talk” to each other,
to understand better the connections between trauma
and behavioral health issues, and to guide systems to
become trauma-informed.


**APPROACH**

SAMHSA approached this task by integrating three
significant threads of work: trauma focused research
work; practice-generated knowledge about trauma
interventions; and the lessons articulated by survivors



_**page 3**_


of traumatic experiences who have had involvement
in multiple service sectors. It was expected that
this blending of the research, practice and survivor
knowledge would generate a framework for improving
the capacity of our service systems and public
institutions to better address the trauma-related issues
of their constituents.


To begin this work, SAMHSA conducted an
environmental scan of trauma definitions and models
of trauma informed care. SAMHSA convened a
group of national experts who had done extensive
work in this area. This included trauma survivors
who had been recipients of care in multiple service
system; practitioners from an array of fields, who had
experience in trauma treatment; researchers whose
work focused on trauma and the development of
trauma-specific interventions; and policymakers in the
field of behavioral health.


From this meeting, SAMHSA developed a working
document summarizing the discussions among these
experts. The document was then vetted among
federal agencies that conduct work in the field of
trauma. Simultaneously, it was placed on a SAMHSA
website for public comment. Federal agency experts
provided rich comments and suggestions; the public
comment site drew just over 2,000 respondents
and 20,000 comments or endorsements of others’
comments. SAMHSA reviewed all of these comments,
made revisions to the document and developed the
framework and guidance presented in this paper.



SAMHSA’s approach to this task has been an attempt
to integrate knowledge developed through research
and clinical practice with the voices of trauma
survivors. This also included experts funded through
SAMHSA’s trauma-focused grants and initiatives,
such as SAMHSA’s National Child Traumatic Stress
Initiative, SAMHSA’s National Center for Trauma
Informed Care, and data and lessons learned from
other grant programs that did not have a primary focus
on trauma but included significant attention to trauma,
such as SAMHSA’s: Jail Diversion Trauma Recovery
grant program; Children’s Mental Health Initiative;
Women, Children and Family Substance Abuse
Treatment Program; and Offender Reentry and Adult
Treatment Drug Court Programs.

types of traumatic events. The connection between trauma and these conditions





The American Psychiatric Association (APA) played an
important role in defining trauma. Diagnostic criteria for
traumatic stress disorders have been debated through
several iterations of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) with a new
category of Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders,
across the life-span, included in the recently released
DSM-V (APA, 2013). Measures and inventories of
trauma exposure, with both clinical and research
applications, have proliferated since the 1970’s. [18,19,20,21]

National trauma research and practice centers have
conducted significant work in the past few decades,
further refining the concept of trauma, and developing
effective trauma assessments and treatments. [22,23,24,25]

With the advances in neuroscience, a biopsychosocial
approach to traumatic experiences has begun to
delineate the mechanisms in which neurobiology,
psychological processes, and social attachment
interact and contribute to mental and substance use
disorders across the life-span. [3,25]


_page 5_



The convergence of the trauma survivor’s perspective
with research and clinical work has underscored the
central role of traumatic experiences in the lives of
people with mental and substance use conditions.
The connection between trauma and these conditions
offers a potential explanatory model for what has
happened to individuals, both children and adults,
who come to the attention of the behavioral health and
other service systems. [25,27]


People with traumatic experiences, however, do not
show up only in behavioral health systems. Responses
to these experiences often manifest in behaviors or
conditions that result in involvement with the child
welfare and the criminal and juvenile justice system or
in difficulties in the education, employment or primary
care system. Recently, there has also been a focus
on individuals in the military and increasing rates of
posttraumatic stress disorders. [28,29,30,31]


With the growing understanding of the pervasiveness
of traumatic experience and responses, a growing
number of clinical interventions for trauma responses
have been developed. Federal research agencies,
academic institutions and practice-research
partnerships have generated empirically-supported
interventions. In SAMHSA’s National Registry of
Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP)
alone there are over 15 interventions focusing on the
treatment or screening for trauma.


These interventions have been integrated into the
behavioral health treatment care delivery system;
however, from the voice of trauma survivors, it has
become clear that these clinical interventions are not
enough. Building on lessons learned from SAMHSA’s
Women, Co-Occurring Disorders and Violence Study;
SAMHSA’s National Child Traumatic Stress Network;
and SAMHSA’s National Center for Trauma-Informed
Care and Alternatives to Seclusion and Restraints,
among other developments in the field, it became
clear that the organizational climate and conditions
in which services are provided played a significant
role in maximizing the outcomes of interventions
and contributing to the healing and recovery of the
people being served. SAMHSA’s National Center for
Trauma-Informed Care has continued to advance this
effort, starting first in the behavioral health sector,
but increasingly responding to technical assistance
requests for organizational change in the criminal
justice, education, and primary care sectors.


**FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL**
**TRAUMA-FOCUSED ACTIVITIES**

The increased understanding of the pervasiveness of
trauma and its connections to physical and behavioral
health and well-being, have propelled a growing
number of organizations and service systems to
explore ways to make their services more responsive
to people who have experienced trauma. This has
been happening in state and local systems and
federal agencies.


States are elevating a focus on trauma. For example,
Oregon Health Authority is looking at different types of
trauma across the age span and different population
groups. Maine’s “Thrive Initiative” incorporates a



trauma-informed care focus in their children’s systems
of care. New York is introducing a trauma-informed
initiative in the juvenile justice system. Missouri is
exploring a trauma-informed approach for their adult
mental health system. In Massachusetts, the Child
Trauma Project is focused on taking trauma-informed
care statewide in child welfare practice. In Connecticut
the Child Health and Development Institute with the
state Department of Children and Families is building
a trauma-informed system of care throughout the
state through policy and workforce development.
SAMHSA has supported the further development of
trauma-informed approaches through its Mental Health
Transformation Grant program directed to State and
local governments.


Increasing examples of local level efforts are being
documented. For example, the City of Tarpon Springs
in Florida has taken significant steps in becoming
a trauma-informed community. The city made it its
mission to promote a widespread awareness of the
costly effects of personal adversity upon the wellbeing
of the community. The Family Policy Council in
Washington State convened groups to focus on the
impact of adverse childhood experiences on the health
and well-being of its local communities and tribal
communities. Philadelphia held a summit to further
its understanding of the impact of trauma and
violence on the psychological and physical health
of its communities.


At the federal level, SAMHSA continues its support of
grant programs that specifically address trauma and
technical assistance centers that focus on prevention,
treatment and recovery from trauma.

### **SAMHSA’s Concept of Trauma**



Decades of work in the field of trauma have generated
multiple definitions of trauma. Combing through this
work, SAMHSA developed an inventory of trauma
definitions and recognized that there were subtle
nuances and differences in these definitions.


Desiring a concept that could be shared among its
constituencies — practitioners, researchers, and
trauma survivors, SAMHSA turned to its expert panel
to help craft a concept that would be relevant to public
health agencies and service systems. SAMHSA aims
to provide a viable framework that can be used to
support people receiving services, communities, and
stakeholders in the work they do. A review of the
existing definitions and discussions of the expert panel
generated the following concept:

### **SAMHSA’s Trauma-Informed Approach: Key Assumptions** **and Principles**



Trauma researchers, practitioners and survivors
have recognized that the understanding of trauma
and trauma-specific interventions is not sufficient
to optimize outcomes for trauma survivors nor to
influence how service systems conduct their business.


The context in which trauma is addressed or
treatments deployed contributes to the outcomes for
the trauma survivors, the people receiving services,
and the individuals staffing the systems. Referred
to variably as “trauma-informed care” or “traumainformed approach” this framework is regarded as
essential to the context of care. [22,32,33] SAMHSA’s
concept of a trauma-informed approach is grounded in
a set of four assumptions and six key principles.


A trauma informed approach is distinct from traumaspecific services or trauma systems. A trauma
informed approach is inclusive of trauma-specific
interventions, whether assessment, treatment or
recovery supports, yet it also incorporates key trauma
principles into the organizational culture.



**THE FOUR “R’S: KEY ASSUMPTIONS IN A**
**TRAUMA-INFORMED APPROACH**

In a trauma-informed approach, all people at all levels
of the organization or system have a basic **realization**
about trauma and understand how trauma can affect
families, groups, organizations, and communities as
well as individuals. People’s experience and behavior
are understood in the context of coping strategies
designed to survive adversity and overwhelming
circumstances, whether these occurred in the past
(i.e., a client dealing with prior child abuse), whether
they are currently manifesting (i.e., a staff member
living with domestic violence in the home), or whether
they are related to the emotional distress that results
in hearing about the firsthand experiences of another
(i.e., secondary traumatic stress experienced by a
direct care professional).There is an understanding
that trauma plays a role in mental and substance use
disorders and should be systematically addressed in
prevention, treatment, and recovery settings. Similarly,
there is a realization that trauma is not confined to
the behavioral health specialty service sector, but is
integral to other systems (e.g., child welfare, criminal
justice, primary health care, peer–run and community
organizations) and is often a barrier to effective
outcomes in those systems as well.


People in the organization or system are also able
to **recognize** the signs of trauma. These signs may
be gender, age, or setting-specific and may be
manifest by individuals seeking or providing services
in these settings. Trauma screening and assessment
assist in the recognition of trauma, as do workforce
development, employee assistance, and supervision
practices.



_page 9_


The program, organization, or system **responds**
by applying the principles of a trauma-informed
approach to all areas of functioning. The program,
organization, or system integrates an understanding
that the experience of traumatic events impacts all
people involved, whether directly or indirectly. Staff in
every part of the organization, from the person who
greets clients at the door to the executives and the
governance board, have changed their language,
behaviors and policies to take into consideration the
experiences of trauma among children and adult users
of the services and among staff providing the services.
This is accomplished through staff training, a budget
that supports this ongoing training, and leadership
that realizes the role of trauma in the lives of their
staff and the people they serve. The organization
has practitioners trained in evidence-based trauma
practices. Policies of the organization, such as mission
statements, staff handbooks and manuals promote
a culture based on beliefs about resilience, recovery,
and healing from trauma. For instance, the agency’s
mission may include an intentional statement on
the organization’s commitment to promote trauma
recovery; agency policies demonstrate a commitment
to incorporating perspectives of people served
through the establishment of client advisory boards
or inclusion of people who have received services on
the agency’s board of directors; or agency training
includes resources for mentoring supervisors on
helping staff address secondary traumatic stress. The
organization is committed to providing a physically and
psychologically safe environment. Leadership ensures
that staff work in an environment that promotes
trust, fairness and transparency. The program’s,
organization’s, or system’s response involves a
universal precautions approach in which one expects
the presence of trauma in lives of individuals being
served, ensuring not to replicate it.


A trauma-informed approach seeks to **resist**
**re-traumatization** of clients as well as staff.
Organizations often inadvertently create stressful or
toxic environments that interfere with the recovery
of clients, the well-being of staff and the fulfillment
of the organizational mission. [27] Staff who work
within a trauma-informed environment are taught
to recognize how organizational practices may



trigger painful memories and re-traumatize clients
with trauma histories. For example, they recognize
that using restraints on a person who has been
sexually abused or placing a child who has been
neglected and abandoned in a seclusion room may
be re-traumatizing and interfere with healing and
recovery.


**SIX KEY PRINCIPLES OF A TRAUMA-**
**INFORMED APPROACH**

A trauma-informed approach reflects adherence to six
key principles rather than a prescribed set of practices
or procedures. These principles may be generalizable
across multiple types of settings, although terminology
and application may be setting- or sector-specific.


From SAMHSA’s perspective, it is critical to
promote the linkage to recovery and resilience for
those individuals and families impacted by trauma.
Consistent with SAMHSA’s definition of recovery,
services and supports that are trauma-informed build
on the best evidence available and consumer and
family engagement, empowerment, and collaboration.

### **Guidance for Implementing a Trauma-Informed Approach**



Developing a trauma-informed approach requires
change at multiples levels of an organization and
systematic alignment with the six key principles
described above. The guidance provided here builds
upon the work of Harris and Fallot and in conjunction
with the key principles, provides a starting point
for developing an organizational trauma-informed
approach. [20] While it is recognized that not all public
institutions and service sectors attend to trauma as an
aspect of how they conduct business, understanding
the role of trauma and a trauma-informed approach
may help them meet their goals and objectives.
Organizations, across service-sectors and systems,
are encouraged to examine how a trauma-informed
approach will benefit all stakeholders; to conduct
a trauma-informed organizational assessment and
change process; and to involve clients and staff at all
levels in the organizational development process.


The guidance for implementing a trauma-informed
approach is presented in the ten domains described
below. This is not provided as a “checklist” or a
prescriptive step-by-step process. These are the
domains of organizational change that have appeared
both in the organizational change management
literature and among models for establishing
trauma-informed care. [35,36,37,38] What makes it unique
to establishing a trauma-informed organizational
approach is the cross-walk with the key principles
and trauma-specific content.

### **Next Steps: Trauma in the Context of Community**



Delving into the work on community trauma is beyond
the scope of this document and will be done in the
next phase of this work. However, recognizing that
many individuals cope with their trauma in the safe or
not-so safe space of their communities, it is important
to know how communities can support or impede the
healing process.


Trauma does not occur in a vacuum. Individual
trauma occurs in a context of community, whether
the community is defined geographically as in
neighborhoods; virtually as in a shared identity,
ethnicity, or experience; or organizationally, as in a
place of work, learning, or worship. How a community
responds to individual trauma sets the foundation
for the impact of the traumatic event, experience,
and effect. Communities that provide a context of
understanding and self-determination may facilitate
the healing and recovery process for the individual.
Alternatively, communities that avoid, overlook, or
misunderstand the impact of trauma may often be
re-traumatizing and interfere with the healing process.
Individuals can be re-traumatized by the very people
whose intent is to be helpful. This is one way to
understand trauma in the context of a community.


A second and equally important perspective on
trauma and communities is the understanding that
communities as a whole can also experience trauma.
Just as with the trauma of an individual or family,
a community may be subjected to a communitythreatening event, have a shared experience of
the event, and have an adverse, prolonged effect.
Whether the result of a natural disaster (e.g., a
flood, a hurricane or an earthquake) or an event or
circumstances inflicted by one group on another (e.g.,
usurping homelands, forced relocation, servitude, or
mass incarceration, ongoing exposure to violence
in the community), the resulting trauma is often
transmitted from one generation to the next in a
pattern often referred to as historical, community, or
intergenerational trauma.



Communities can collectively react to trauma in
ways that are very similar to the ways in which
individuals respond. They can become hyper-vigilant,
fearful, or they can be re-traumatized, triggered by
circumstances resembling earlier trauma. Trauma
can be built into cultural norms and passed from
generation to generation. Communities are often
profoundly shaped by their trauma histories. Making
sense of the trauma experience and telling the story
of what happened using the language and framework
of the community is an important step toward healing
community trauma.


Many people who experience trauma readily overcome
it and continue on with their lives; some become
stronger and more resilient; for others, the trauma
is overwhelming and their lives get derailed. Some
may get help in formal support systems; however, the
vast majority will not. The manner in which individuals
and families can mobilize the resources and support
of their communities and the degree to which the
community has the capacity, knowledge, and skills
to understand and respond to the adverse effects of
trauma has significant implications for the well-being of
the people in their community.

### **Conclusion**


As the concept of a trauma-informed approach has
become a central focus in multiple service sectors,
SAMHSA desires to promote a shared understanding
of this concept. The working definitions, key principles,
and guidance presented in this document represent
a beginning step toward clarifying the meaning of this
concept. This document builds upon the extensive
work of researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and
people with lived experience in the field. A standard,
unified working concept will serve to advance the
understanding of trauma and a trauma-informed
approach for public institutions and service sectors.
