### **GROUP THERAPY IN SUBSTANCE** **USE TREATMENT**

Group therapy is a therapy modality wherein clients learn and practice recovery strategies, build
interpersonal skills, and reinforce and develop social support networks. It typically involves a group
of 6 to 12 clients who meet on a regular basis with one or two group therapists. The 2019 National
Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services reports that 93 percent of substance use disorder
(SUD) treatment facilities, across different settings, provide group therapy (Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2020). The popularity of this type of group therapy
has been shaped by the influence of mutual-support groups, the potential for cost containment, and
its efficiency in delivering psychoeducation while teaching coping skills to many individuals at once.

Based on SAMHSA’s [Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) 41,](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/TIP-41-Substance-Abuse-Treatment-Group-Therapy/SMA15-3991) _Substance Abuse Treatment:_
_[Group Therapy](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/TIP-41-Substance-Abuse-Treatment-Group-Therapy/SMA15-3991)_, this _Advisory_ provides an overview of goals, processes, group-specific approaches,
resources, and common elements that support favorable outcomes in group therapy. It does
not address nontreatment groups, specifically peer and mutual-support groups. Nonetheless,
these groups can also support recovery and add significant value to the treatment process (e.g.,
reinforcing coping strategies, modeling recovery behavior, providing hope, and minimizing the stigma
often associated with SUDs).


_**Key Messages**_

**●** Group therapy, used extensively in SUD treatment, consists of individual theoretical
approaches adapted to the development of specialized manual-based group treatments.

**●** Several core processes predict outcomes in many SUD group therapy settings, including
therapeutic alliance, group affiliation, and culturally responsive practices.

**●** Across the continuum of care, group therapy can be an effective and efficient modality for
improving treatment engagement, developing and practicing coping skills, and supporting
recovery.

**●** Group therapy is one of the most common approaches in SUD treatment settings. There
is broad need for clinical supervision and formal training in specific group processes and
dynamics, as well as evidence-based SUD group therapies.


Group therapy has therapeutic advantages. It provides potential benefits in promoting social support,
reducing isolation and stigma, developing effective communication and interpersonal skills, and
practicing recovery-oriented coping strategies with group members (Wendt & Gone, 2017; Wenzel
et al., 2012). There is a growing body of evidence that group therapy is cost effective and produces

client outcomes comparable to individual therapy in SUD treatment acceptance, retention, reductions in
frequency of use, abstinence rates, and psychological symptoms and distress (Burlingame et al., 2016; Lo
Coco et al., 2019; Olmstead et al., 2019; Sobell & Sobell, 2011; Sobell et al., 2009). Adding group therapy
as a component to individually oriented SUD treatment approaches improves treatment engagement,
abstinence rates, and perceived peer support (de Moura et al., 2017).

#### **Groups in SUD Treatment: An Overview**

Group therapy is a common way to deliver SUD treatment interventions in various types of treatment
settings. Group therapy is used in hospital-based units providing medically supervised withdrawal, outpatient
and intensive outpatient programs, nonhospital residential treatment centers, halfway houses, continuing
care groups, and outpatient groups for those engaged in medication-assisted treatment (Pugatch et al.,
2014; Sokol et al., 2018).

Groups differ in their overall purpose and goals. Some groups address a specific point in recovery, such as
early recovery and relapse prevention. Other groups provide psychoeducation on various topics, including
the consequences of SUDs, family impact, and the use of support systems. Other groups focus on managing
specific co-occurring health conditions (e.g., HIV/AIDS), psychological symptoms (e.g., anger management),
and mental disorders (e.g., social anxiety, mood disorders). Groups may focus on populations (e.g., genderand age-specific and criminal justice groups).
There are culturally specific groups that
integrate cultural practices and values
into treatment and others that provide
an affirming space for recovery (e.g., for
LGBTQ+ individuals).







Many SUD treatment programs use individual
theoretical approaches and rework them into
group therapy (Wendt & Gone, 2017). Groups
often use a combination of strategies, such as
motivational interviewing, stages-of-change
interventions, psychoeducation, supportive
approaches, and skill development. In the
past decade, evidence-based group therapies
for SUDs have evolved using motivational f
and cognitive–behavioral approaches or a
combination of both (Sobell & Sobell, 2011).


_**Group member selection**_
Matching clients with the appropriate group
is vital to successful treatment. In addition to
admission criteria and the group’s purpose,
a client’s needs, current goals, and ability to
participate determine appropriateness. For
example, a female client who presents with an
SUD and trauma history may be better served

in a women-only group. Clients who are not suited for group therapy should be reevaluated if conditions
change. The following list describes client circumstances that may justify ruling out group therapy at a
particular point in time (American Group Psychotherapy Association, 2007; Greenfield et al., 2014):

**●** Inability to attend group therapy regularly

**●** Currently misusing substances

**●** Intellectual disability or a neurocognitive disorder that prevents the client from communicating with other
group members, understanding or attending to the group process, or following through with group tasks

**●** Current psychosis, mania, or other symptoms that would hamper participation

**●** Inability to follow group rules established by the treatment program and group members



_**Elements that enhance outcomes: Group**_
_**cohesion and therapeutic alliance**_
Group cohesion and therapeutic alliance improve
outcomes for individuals who participate in group
therapy for SUDs. Favorable outcomes include
treatment acceptance, engagement, and retention
in group therapy, as well as enhanced abstinence
rates or reduction in substance misuse frequency.


**●** **Group cohesion** refers to the quality of
relationships among group members,
including the client–therapist connection. It
includes the perception of interpersonal and
emotional support and affiliation in the group
(Burlingame et al., 2018; Dolgin et al., 2020;
Sugarman et al., 2016; Yalom & Leszcz,
2005). Group cohesion is associated with
positive outcomes across treatment settings,
theoretical approaches, and client populations.
Group therapists should encourage member–
member interactions rather than conducting
individual therapy in a group format, model
how members can give balanced positive
and negative feedback, and highlight
commonalities and foster similar experiences
among group members (Burlingame et al.,
2018; Kivlighan et al., 2020; Sobell & Sobell,
2011; Valeri et al., 2018).

**●** **Therapeutic alliance** is the development of
a working relationship and bond between a
group member and therapist. It includes an
agreement on goals and tasks to address
the presenting problems (Ardito & Rabellino,
2011; Bordin, 1979; Martin & Garske, 2000).
Group therapists begin to foster therapeutic



_**Enhancing Group Cohesion**_

**●** Ask members to share if they ever experienced
a similar circumstance, feeling, or thought as
expressed by a specific group member.

**●** Ask the group to provide feedback to another
group member on what they see as working
well and what is not working so well regarding
self-care.

**●** Brainstorm with the group about how to
manage a specific high-risk situation using a
concrete example from a group member.

**●** Use role-plays to practice coping or refusal
skills, then reverse roles so that another
member can experience and empathize with
the group member’s situation while learning
recovery skills.


_**Enhancing Therapeutic Alliance**_
Prior to participation, walk through an example
of a typical group session. Talk about how
group sessions begin and end. Discuss normal
experiences in group sessions, such as being
anxious about giving feedback to another
member or sharing an experience or emotions
with the entire group, hearing a painful story from
another participant, or learning about a member
leaving the group. A key ingredient in building
alliance is using reflective listening and periodic
check-ins, (e.g., “Is it okay with you if I share
what I just heard and observed?”).

alliance with the first interaction with a client.
Group therapists should prepare clients to join
the group by explaining the group process,
treatment expectations, and group rules prior to
participation. Furthermore, they should develop
shared goals for group therapy. In group
sessions, therapists adopt culturally responsive
practices to build alliance and show support
and empathy as the client negotiates recovery
challenges. Therapeutic alliance is associated
with positive group treatment outcomes across
theoretical approaches and client populations
(Crits-Christoph et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2015;
Flückiger et al., 2013; Meier et al., 2005; Sobell
& Sobell, 2011; von Greiff & Skogens, 2019).



_**Stigma**_
Stigma is a process in which people with SUDs
are devalued, labeled, and excluded in society.
It fosters health inequalities and is associated
with negative outcomes for those with SUDs.
Stigma is linked to premature discontinuation
of treatment, increased risky behavior, and
delayed recovery. Stigma can be self-imposed
or imposed by others, including other group
members, family, staff, and society. Person-first
language, positive recovery stories, acceptance,
and commitment to group therapy may help
address stigma and its far-reaching effects
(Livingston et al., 2012; Luoma et al., 2008,
2014). In addition, community-based approaches
may decrease stigma through social media
messaging and education about SUDs and their
contributing factors. Stigma can be reduced by
community recovery activities and advocacy
groups (e.g., recovery runs/walks, public policy
forums, the use of recovery ambassadors)
(National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine, 2016).

Group therapists should be mindful that new clients community recovery activities and advocacy
are typically in unfamiliar territory, unacquainted groups (e.g., recovery runs/walks, public policy

preparation occurs prior to group attendance. The
preparation should address when the client will end
group therapy and the process of termination, including available continuing care services and the process of
referring clients, which may be handled by a case manager or aftercare coordinator (Sobell & Sobell, 2011).


#### **Group Structure and Development**

_**Group structure and formats**_
Most studies evaluating group SUD treatments use a fixed number of sessions, closed-group format, and
manual-based approaches. Less is known about SUD treatment groups with open formats, varied session
lengths, and those that use nonmanualized approaches. Factors to consider include the following:




**●** Closed groups offer advantages in evaluating
treatment effectiveness using a specific
approach or strategy. Closed groups are
more likely to build group cohesiveness and
support among members, resulting in less
client turnover, which is associated with better
outcomes (Pavia et al., 2016; Sobell & Sobell,
2011; Wendt & Gone, 2017).



_**Open and Closed Groups**_
Open groups accept group members on a rolling
basis with no end date. Clients can enter group at
any time. Closed groups have a specific start and
end date and typically accept clients only at the
beginning of the process (Sobell & Sobell, 2011).




**●** Group therapists in SUD treatment may
transition in and out of group due to staffing demands. This may disrupt group cohesiveness, trust, and
the level of self-disclosure. Treatment providers should avoid this practice whenever possible (MorganLopez & Fals-Stewart, 2008).

## ADVISORY


**●** Therapists’ ability to use and adapt specific techniques as situations in the group dictate (as opposed
to using predetermined exercises and content) is associated with better outcomes in general. There is
some evidence that clients become dissatisfied within open group formats when the same content is
reintroduced to new members. Consequently, less time is devoted to group interaction and there are
fewer opportunities to build on content and group processes from previous sessions. Client satisfaction is
not only tied to treatment engagement but also to outcomes (Owen & Hilsenroth, 2014).

_**Agenda setting**_
To effectively facilitate an SUD group, therapists need to prepare and set an agenda for each session,
because predictability helps create a safe and therapeutic working environment (Sobell & Sobell, 2011).
However, counselors should remain flexible and open to changing the agenda as needed. Agendas should
emphasize elements of the group that will be consistent across all sessions. This means that therapists need
to mark the opening and closing of sessions in the same way each time. Agendas used in early sessions
might also cover the reinforcement of group rules and how group members share or provide feedback. If
needed, the counselor can add these items to later agendas as reminders. In addition to group processes,
agendas can also cover session content, like planned exercises, educational material, and content to
address individual and group-specific concerns and needs.


_**Group size**_
There is no consensus on the most effective group size in SUD treatment. Literature suggests that group
size should range from 6 to 12 individuals to effectively address clients’ needs and to enable all members to
participate (Sobell & Sobell, 2011; Velasquez et al., 2016). Group size also depends on the purpose of group
therapy. For example, groups that focus on education with some processing and sharing may effectively
accommodate larger groups (e.g., psychoeducational multifamily group sessions). Groups with fewer than
six members are less likely to survive as a result of attrition and absenteeism, whereas larger groups are
likely to have fewer member–member interactions (Wendt & Gone, 2018; Yalom & Leszcz, 2005). There is
no scientific determination of maximum group size; group size restrictions vary across states, counties, and
healthcare delivery systems and insurance plans.



_**Culturally responsive practices**_
Although there is recognition of the importance of
developing cultural competence in SUD treatment,
little research is available on culturally responsive
practices in group therapy. One study of 13 SUD
treatment providers found that racial, ethnic, and
cultural considerations were not regularly integrated
into the group process (Wendt & Gone, 2018).



_**Culture**_
Culture includes race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion,
sexual orientation, ability, geographic region, and
class. Culture involves shared beliefs, values, and
practices. In group therapy, culture not only shapes
help-seeking behaviors and beliefs about illness and
treatment, but also communication patterns within the
group (Cohen, 2009; Sue et al., 2019).



Developing cultural competence is an ongoing
learning process. It involves the following components across modalities and settings (Sue et al., 2019):

**●** **Cultural awareness:** The willingness and ability to recognize and self-reflect on the importance of race,
ethnicity, and culture—that not everyone shares the same beliefs, values, practices, or experiences. Cultural
awareness is the recognition that these attributes play a significant role in all group interactions and in the
interpretation of communication and actions of others in the group. Cultural humility is also part of cultural
awareness—the commitment to lifelong learning, self-reflection, showing interest in others, and understanding
that imbalances in power and privilege exist among clients, co-workers, and administrative staff (Tervalon &
Murray-Garcia, 1998).

## ADVISORY


**●** **Cultural knowledge:** A commitment to learning about other cultures by researching, using a cultural
guide or mentor from the group population, attending culturally specific events, and asking group
members about their culture with a welcoming and inquisitive attitude. Being culturally responsive
means addressing how group dynamics may produce further burden on clients at a time when they
need services. It involves the recognition of how culture, racism, discrimination, and microaggressions
affect individual group members, group processes, and communication, regardless of the group therapy
approach (Harris, 2012; Kivlighan et al., 2019).

**●** **Cultural knowledge of behavioral health:** Learning about healing practices, help-seeking preferences,
and acceptable treatments reflected in the group composition. For example, some cultures have specific
names for emotional and behavioral problems and cultural explanations for their cause. Other cultures
are more likely to distrust behavioral healthcare services and institutions. Group members from some
cultures may be more likely to express mental distress through physical symptoms. All cultures have
prescribed ways of viewing emotional issues and drug and alcohol misuse.




**●** **Cultural skills:** Anticipating culturally specific
needs of group members. An essential cultural
skill in group therapy is effective, appropriate, and
respectful communication, including knowledge
about body language, attention to gestures and
touch, and vigilance about microaggressions that
might occur in group process. Other skills include
securing translation services, surmounting language
barriers, anticipating need for accessibility services,
and using culturally specific community resources.
Being responsive to cultural diversities can make the
difference in how group members respond to services
and in treatment outcomes (Gainsbury, 2017;
Kivlighan et al., 2019).



_**Microaggressions**_
Microaggressions are derogatory comments,
insults, or nonverbal behaviors, whether
intentional or unintentional, that reflect
prejudice, hostility, stereotypes, and
generalizations toward a person based solely
on their membership in a marginalized group
(such as gender identity, ethnicity, race,
sexual orientation, socioeconomic status).
The effects of microaggressions can be
cumulative and affect mental and physical
health (Nadal et al., 2014; Sue, 2010; Wang
et al., 2011).



_**Groups across the continuum of care**_
Across the continuum of care, SUD treatment groups use support, psychoeducation, skill development, and
interpersonal processes to assist clients in addressing their emotions, thoughts, and behavior in recovery.
Irrespective of setting, population, and the clients’ phase of recovery, most SUD treatment groups use a
combination of motivational interviewing, cognitive–behavioral, and stages-of-change strategies. Early
recovery groups are more likely to focus on psychoeducation, support, and skill development, while late
recovery groups tend to emphasize relapse prevention, social skills, and relationship concerns.

#### **Group Approaches in SUD Treatment**

Group-specific SUD treatment approaches are divided into three areas: theoretical models, populations, and
clinical issues. The following reference lists reflect a sample of some current approaches:

#### **Group Facilitation and Professional Development**


_**SUD group therapists’ credentials**_
Foremost, the therapist needs to abide by the ethical and professional standards of their credentialing and
governing bodies. Each state has its own licensing, certification, and supervision requirements that enable
SUD counselors to provide services. Those services include, but are not limited to, both individual and group
therapy (National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, 2013). There is no specific SUD
group therapy license or certification designation.


_**Fundamental skills of a group therapist**_
In addition to helping clients integrate into a new group, reinforcing group rules, and facilitating the group
process during sessions, the therapist needs to promote emotional safety. Safety involves setting limits,
redirecting topics, and helping group members process difficult exchanges, behaviors, and feelings.

Clients need to feel support and compassion from the group therapist. The therapist must build an alliance
with each member and facilitate and promote communication among members so that they share with
and learn from each other. The therapist maintains the focus on individual and group goals throughout the
process. Though many SUD treatment therapists use primarily psychoeducation in groups (Wendt & Gone,
2017), group facilitation should include a combination of supportive, skill building, and relational strategies to
capitalize on the benefits of group therapy.


_**Common challenges in providing group therapy**_
Despite the fact that group therapy is a main modality in SUD treatment, there is little research that
addresses group-specific interventions and formats. This disparity between practice and supporting research
results in several challenges:

**●** Providers rely on individual approaches in group therapy.

**●** Evidence-based group-specific treatments are often thought to be inflexible.

**●** Training in how to facilitate group therapy, including group dynamics, is not widely available.

## ADVISORY

For providers, studies support the benefits of early training in group skills and principles, culturally responsive
group practices, and management of group dynamics. Therapists need support and training in how to use
group-specific resources, and when and how to deviate from session agendas to maintain flexible clinical
strategies (Flückiger et al., 2013; Wendt & Gone, 2017, 2018).


_**Professional development**_
Even though state requirements differ and there is no specific SUD group therapy license or certification,
therapists who provide group therapy in SUD treatment need to commit to professional development in
group-specific skills and competencies. These activities include training opportunities in general group
therapy, adopting guidelines for best and evidence-based practices designed specifically for SUD treatment,
and engaging in supervision. Supervision specific to group practice should include establishing professional
development plans; providing support and guidance in group dynamics, strategies, and modalities; and
engaging in evaluative processes to support adoption of group-specific competencies.
