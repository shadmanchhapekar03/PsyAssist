##### **Foreword**

Substance use and abuse often coexist with anger and violence. Data from the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Household Survey on Drug Abuse,
for example, indicated that 40 percent of frequent cocaine users reported engaging in some
form of violent behavior. Anger and violence often can have a causal role in the initiation of
drug and alcohol use and can also be a consequence associated with substance abuse.
Individuals who experience traumatic events, for example, often experience anger and act vio­
lently, as well as abuse drugs or alcohol.


Clinicians often see how anger and violence and substance use are linked.


Many substance abuse and mental health clients are victims of traumatic life events, which,
in turn, lead to substance use, anger, and violence.


Despite the connection of anger and violence to substance abuse, few treatments have been
developed to address anger and violence problems among people who abuse substances.
Clinicians have found the dearth of treatment approaches for this important issue disheartening.


To provide clinicians with tools to help deal with this important issue, the Center for Substance
Abuse Treatment of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is
pleased to present _Anger Management for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients:_
_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_ and its companion book _Anger Management for_
_Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients: Participant Workbook_ .


The anger management treatment design in this manual, which has been delivered to hun­
dreds of clients over the past 8 years, has been popular with both clinicians and clients. This
treatment design can be used in a variety of clinical settings and will be beneficial to the field.

##### **Introduction**

This manual was designed for use by qualified substance abuse and mental health clinicians
who work with substance abuse and mental health clients with concurrent anger problems.
The manual describes a 12-week cognitive behavioral anger management group treatment.
Each of the 12 90-minute weekly sessions is described in detail with specific instructions for
group leaders, tables and figures that illustrate the key conceptual components of the treat­
ment, and homework assignments for the group participants. An accompanying Participant
Workbook is available (see _Anger Management for Substance Abuse and Mental Health_
_Clients: Participant Workbook,_ Reilly, Shopshire, Durazzo, & Campbell, 2002) and should be
used in conjunction with this manual to enable the participants to better learn, practice, and
integrate the treatment strategies presented in the group sessions. This intervention was devel­
oped for studies at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs (SFVA) Medical Center and San
Francisco General Hospital.


Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatments have been found to be effective, time-limited
treatments for anger problems (Beck & Fernandez, 1998; Deffenbacher, 1996; Trafate, 1995).
Four types of CBT interventions, theoretically unified by principles of social learning theory, are
most often used when treating anger disorders:


- _Relaxation interventions,_ which target emotional and physiological components of anger


- _Cognitive interventions,_ which target cognitive processes such as hostile appraisals and
attributions, irrational beliefs, and inflammatory thinking


- _Communication skills interventions,_ which target deficits in assertiveness and conflict reso­
lution skills


- _Combined interventions,_ which integrate two or more CBT interventions and target multiple
response domains (Deffenbacher, 1996, 1999).


Meta-analysis studies (Beck & Fernandez, 1998; Edmondson & Conger, 1996; Trafate, 1995)
conclude that there are moderate anger reduction effects for CBT interventions, with average
effect sizes ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 (Deffenbacher, 1999). From these studies, it can be
inferred that the average participant under CBT conditions fared better than 76 percent of con­
trol participants. These results are consistent with other meta-analysis studies examining the
effectiveness of CBT interventions in the treatment of depression (Dobson, 1989) and anxiety
(Van Balkom et al., 1994).


The treatment model described in this manual is a combined CBT approach that employs relax­
ation, cognitive, and communication skills interventions.


# _1_


Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


This combined approach presents the participants with options that draw on these different
interventions and then encourages them to develop individualized anger control plans using as
many of the techniques as possible. Not all the participants use all the techniques and inter­
ventions presented in the treatment (e.g., cognitive restructuring), but almost all finish the
treatment with more than one technique or intervention on their anger control plans.


Theoretically, the more techniques and interventions an individual has on his or her anger
control plan, the better equipped he or she will be to manage anger in response to angerprovoking events.


In studies at the SFVA Medical Center and San Francisco General Hospital using this treatment
model, significant reductions in self-reported anger and violence have consistently been found,
as well as decreased substance use (Reilly, Clark, Shopshire, & Delucchi, 1995; Reilly,
Shopshire, & Clark, 1999; Reilly & Shopshire, 2000; Shopshire, Reilly, & Ouaou, 1996). Most
participants in these studies met _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_, 4th
Edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria for substance dependence,
and many also met DSM-IV criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. A study comparing
Caucasian and African-American patients found that patients from both groups reduced their
anger significantly (Clark, Reilly, Shopshire, & Campbell, 1996). Another study showed that
women also benefited from the intervention—that is, reported decreased levels of anger (Reilly
et al., 1996).


In the anger management studies using this manual, the majority of patients were from ethnic
minority groups. Consistent reductions in anger and aggressive behavior occurred in these
groups, indicating that anger management group treatment is effective. The treatment model
is flexible and can accommodate racial, cultural, and gender issues. The events or situations
that trigger someone’s anger may vary somewhat depending on his or her culture or gender.
The cues or warning signs of anger may vary in this regard as well. Nevertheless, the overall
treatment model still applies and was found effective with different ethnic groups and with
both men and women. A person still has to identify the triggering event, recognize the cues to
anger, and develop anger management (cognitive behavioral) strategies in response to the
event and cues, regardless of whether these events and cues are different for other men and
women or for people in other cultural groups.


The intervention involves developing individualized anger control plans. For example, some
women identified their relationships with their boyfriends or partners or parenting concerns as
events that triggered their anger but men rarely identified these issues. Effective individual
strategies could be developed, however, to address these issues, provided the women accept
the concepts of monitoring anger (using the anger meter) and having (and using) an anger con­
trol plan.


This treatment model was also used successfully with non–substance-abusing clients seen in
the outpatient SFVA Mental Health Clinic. These clients were diagnosed with a variety of prob­
lems, including mood, anxiety, and thought disorders. The treatment components described in
this manual served as the core treatment in these studies.

_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


The anger management treatment should be delivered in a group setting. The ideal number of
participants in a group is 8, but groups can range from 5 to 10 members. There are several
reasons for this recommendation. First, solid empirical support exists for group cognitive
behavioral interventions (Carroll, Rounsaville, & Gawin, 1991; Maude-Griffin et al., 1998;
Smokowski & Wodarski, 1996); second, group treatment is efficient and cost-effective (Hoyt,
1993; Piper & Joyce, 1996); and third, it provides a greater range of possibilities and flexibility
in roleplays (Yalom, 1995) and behavioral rehearsal activities (Heimberg & Juster, 1994; Juster
& Heimberg, 1995). Counselors and social workers should have training in cognitive behavioral
therapy, group therapy, and substance abuse treatment (preferably, at the master’s level or
higher; doctoral-level psychologists have delivered the anger management treatment as well).


Although a group format is recommended for the anger management treatment, it is possible
for qualified clinicians to use this manual in individual sessions with their clients. In this case,
the same treatment format and sequence can be used. Individual sessions provide more time
for in-depth instruction and individualized behavioral rehearsal.


The anger management treatment manual is designed for adult male and female substance
abuse and mental health clients (age 18 years and above). The groups studied at SFVA
Medical Center and San Francisco General Hospital have included patients who have used
many substances (e.g., cocaine, alcohol, heroin, methamphetamine). These patients have been
able to use the anger management materials and benefit from the group treatment despite dif­
ferences in their primary drug of abuse.


It is recommended that participants be abstinent from drugs and alcohol for at least 2 weeks
prior to joining the anger management group. If a participant had a “slip” during his or her
enrollment in the group, he or she was not discharged from the group. However, if he or she
had repeated slips or a full-blown relapse, the individual was referred to a more intensified
treatment setting and asked to start the anger management treatment again.


Many group participants were diagnosed with co-occurring disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress
disorder [PTSD], mood disorder, psychosis) but benefited from the anger management group
treatment. Patients were compliant with their psychiatric medication regimen and were moni­
tored by interdisciplinary treatment teams. The San Francisco group found that, if patients
were compliant with their medication regimen and abstinent from drugs and alcohol, they
could comprehend the treatment material and effectively use concepts such as timeouts and
thought stopping to manage anger. However, if a participant had a history of severe mental ill­
ness, did not comply with instructions on his or her psychiatric medication regimen, and had
difficulty processing the material or accepting group feedback, he or she was referred to his or
her psychiatrist for better medication management.


Several practitioners have requested the manual to work with adolescent clients in substance
abuse treatment, but no preliminary data from these treatment encounters are available.


Because of the many problems often experienced by substance abuse and mental health
clients, this intervention should be used as an adjunctive treatment to substance abuse and
# _3_

mental health treatment. Certain issues, such as anger related to clients’ family of origin and
past learning, for example, may best be explored in individual and group therapy outside the
anger management group.


Finally, the authors stress the importance of providing ongoing anger management aftercare
groups. Participants at the SFVA Medical Center repeatedly asked to attend aftercare groups
where they could continue to practice and integrate the anger management strategies they
learned in this treatment. At the SFVA Medical Center, both an ongoing drop-in group and a
more structured 12-week phase-two group were provided as aftercare components. These
groups help participants maintain (and further reduce) the decreased level of anger and
aggression they achieved during the initial 12-week anger management group treatment.
Participants can also be referred to anger management groups in the community.


It is hoped that this anger management manual will help substance abuse and mental health
clinicians provide effective anger management treatment to clients who experience anger prob­
lems. Reductions in frequent and intense anger and its destructive consequences can lead to
improved physical and mental health of individuals and families.

##### **How To Use This Manual**

The information presented in this manual is intended to allow qualified mental health and sub­
stance abuse professionals to deliver group cognitive behavioral anger management treatment
to clients with substance abuse and mental health disorders. Each of the 12 90-minute weekly
sessions is divided into four sections:


- Instructions to Group Leaders


- Check-In Procedure (beginning in the second session)


- Suggested Remarks


- Homework Assignments.


The Instructions to Group Leaders section summarizes the information to be presented in the
session and outlines the key conceptual components. The Check-In Procedure section provides
a structured process by which group members check in at each session and report on the
progress of their homework assignments from the previous week. The Suggested Remarks sec­
tion provides narrative scripts for the group leader presenting the material in the session.
_Although the group leader is not required to read the scripts verbatim, the group leader should_
_deliver the information as closely as possible to the way it is in the script._ The Homework
Assignment section provides instructions for group members on what tasks to review and prac­
tice for the next meeting. Session 1 also includes a special section that provides an overview
of the anger management treatment and outlines the group rules.


This manual should be used in conjunction with the _Anger Management for Substance Abuse_
_and Mental Health Clients: Participant Workbook_ (Reilly, Shopshire, Durazzo, & Campbell,
2002). The workbook provides group members with a summary of the information presented in
each session, worksheets for completing homework assignments, and space to take notes dur­
ing each session. The workbook will facilitate the completion of homework assignments and
help reinforce the concepts presented over the course of the anger management treatment
program.


Although participants are kept busy in each session, 90 minutes should be enough time to
complete the tasks at hand. The group leader needs to monitor and, at times, limit the
responses of participants, however. This can be done by redirecting them to the question or
activity.

##### **Overview of Group Anger** **Management Treatment**


###### Session 1

Instructions to Group Leaders


In the first session, the purpose, overview, group
rules, conceptual framework, and rationale for the
anger management treatment are presented. Most
of this session is spent presenting conceptual infor­
mation and verifying that the group members
understand it. Then the leader takes the group
members through an introductory exercise and a
presentation of the anger meter.


Suggested Remarks
_(Present the following script or put this in your_
_own words.)_


_Purpose and Overview_


The purpose of the anger management group is to:


1. Learn to manage anger


2. Stop violence or the threat of violence


3. Develop self-control over thoughts and actions


4. Receive support and feedback from others.


_Group Rules_



Outline of Session 1


- Instructions to Group Leaders


- Suggested Remarks


  - Purpose and Overview


  - Group Rules


  - The Problem of Anger:
Some Operational Definitions


  - Myths About Anger


  - Anger as a Habitual Response


  - Breaking the Anger Habit


  - Participant Introductions


  - Anger Meter


- Homework Assignment



1. Group Safety: No violence or threats toward staff and other group members is allowed. It is
important that members perceive the group as a safe place to share their experiences and
feelings without threats or possible physical harm.


2. Confidentiality: Group members should not discuss outside the group what group members
say during group sessions. There are limits to confidentiality, however. In every State, health
laws govern how and when professionals must report certain actions to the proper authori­
ties. These actions may include any physical or sexual abuse inflicted on a child younger
# _7_


Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


than age 18, a person older than age 65, or a dependent adult. A dependent adult is
someone between 18 and 64 years who has physical or mental limitations that restrict his
or her ability to carry out normal activities or to protect his or her rights. Reporting abuse of
these persons supersedes confidentiality laws involving clients and health professionals.
Similarly, if a group member makes threats to physically harm or kill another person, the
group leader is required, under the Tarasoff Ruling ( _Tarasoff_ v. _Regents of the University of_
_California,_ 529 P.2d 553 (Cal. 1974), vacated, reheard en bank, and affirmed, 131 Cal.
Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334 (1976)), to warn the intended victim and notify the police.


3. Homework Assignments: Brief homework assignments will be given each week. Doing the
homework assignments will improve group members’ anger management skills and allow
them to get the most from the group experience. Like any type of skill acquisition, anger
management requires time and practice. Homework assignments provide the opportunity
for skill development and refinement.


4. Absences and Cancellations: Members should call or otherwise notify the group leader in
advance when they cannot attend a session. Because of the amount of material presented
in each session, members may not miss more than 3 of the 12 sessions. If a group mem­
ber misses more than three sessions, he or she would not be able to adequately learn,
practice, and apply the concepts and skills that are necessary for effective anger manage­
ment. He or she can continue to attend the group sessions, but the group member will not
receive a certificate of completion. He or she can join another session as space becomes
available.


5. Timeout: The group leader reserves the right to call for a timeout. If a group member’s
anger begins to escalate out of control during a session, the leader will ask that member to
take a timeout from the topic and the discussion. This means that the member, along with
the rest of the members of the group, _will immediately stop talking about the issue_ that is
causing the member’s anger to escalate. If the participant’s anger has escalated to the
point that he or she cannot tolerate sitting in the group, the leader may ask the person to
leave the group for 5 or 10 minutes or until he or she can cool down. The participant is
then welcomed back to the group, provided he or she can tolerate continued discussion in
the group.


A timeout is an effective anger management strategy and will be discussed in more detail
later in this session and in session 3. Eventually, group members will learn to call a timeout
themselves when they feel they may be losing control as the result of escalation of their
anger. For this session, however, it is essential that the leader calls for a timeout and that
members comply with the rule. This rule helps ensure that the group will be a safe place to
discuss and share experiences and feelings. Therefore, failure to comply with the timeout
rule may lead to termination from the group.


6. Relapses: If a participant has a relapse during his or her enrollment in the group, he or she
is not discharged. However, if the participant has repeated relapses, he or she will be
asked to start the treatment again and will be referred to a more intense treatment setting.

_The Problem of Anger: Some Operational Definitions_


In the most general sense, anger is a feeling or emotion that ranges from mild irritation to
intense fury and rage. Anger is a natural response to those situations where we feel threat­
ened, we believe harm will come to us, or we believe that another person has unnecessarily
wronged us. We may also become angry when we feel another person, like a child or someone
close to us, is being threatened or harmed. In addition, anger may result from frustration when
our needs, desires, and goals are not being met. When we become angry, we may lose our
patience and act impulsively, aggressively, or violently.


People often confuse anger with aggression. Aggression is _behavior_ that is intended to cause
harm to another person or damage property. This behavior can include verbal abuse, threats,
or violent acts. Anger, on the other hand, is an _emotion_ and does not necessarily lead to
aggression. Therefore, a person can become angry without acting aggressively.


A term related to anger and aggression is hostility. Hostility refers to a complex set of attitudes
and judgments that motivate aggressive behaviors. Whereas anger is an emotion and
aggression is a behavior, hostility is an attitude that involves disliking others and evaluating
them negatively.


In this group, clients will learn helpful strategies and techniques to manage anger, express
anger in alternative ways, change hostile attitudes, and prevent aggressive acts, such as verbal
abuse and violence.


_When Does Anger Become a Problem?_


Anger becomes a problem when it is felt too intensely, is felt too frequently, or is expressed
inappropriately. Feeling anger too intensely or frequently places extreme physical strain on the
body. During prolonged and frequent episodes of anger, certain divisions of the nervous sys­
tem become highly activated. Consequently, blood pressure and heart rate increase and stay
elevated for long periods. This stress on the body may produce many different health problems,
such as hypertension, heart disease, and diminished immune system efficiency. Thus, from a
health standpoint, avoiding physical illness is a motivation for controlling anger.


Another compelling reason to control anger concerns the negative consequences that result
from expressing anger inappropriately. In the extreme, anger may lead to violence or physical
aggression, which can result in numerous negative consequences, such as being arrested or
jailed, being physically injured, being retaliated against, losing loved ones, being terminated
from a substance abuse treatment or social service program, or feeling guilt, shame, or regret.


Even when anger does not lead to violence, the inappropriate expression of anger, such as ver­
bal abuse or intimidating or threatening behavior, often results in negative consequences. For
example, it is likely that others will develop fear, resentment, and lack of trust toward those
who subject them to angry outbursts, which may cause alienation from individuals, such as
family members, friends, and coworkers.

# _9_


Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


_Payoffs and Consequences_


The inappropriate expression of anger initially has many apparent payoffs. One payoff is being
able to manipulate and control others through aggressive and intimidating behavior; others
may comply with someone’s demands because they fear verbal threats or violence. Another
payoff is the release of tension that occurs when one loses his or her temper and acts aggres­
sively. The individual may feel better after an angry outburst, but everyone else may feel worse.


In the long term, however, these initial payoffs lead to negative consequences. For this reason
they are called “apparent” payoffs because the long-term negative consequences far outweigh
the short-term gains. For example, consider a father who persuades his children to comply with
his demands by using an angry tone of voice and threatening gestures. These behaviors imply
to the children that they will receive physical harm if they are not obedient. The immediate pay­
off for the father is that the children obey his commands. The long-term consequence, howev­
er, may be that the children learn to fear or dislike him and become emotionally detached from
him. As they grow older, they may avoid contact with him or refuse to see him altogether.


_Myths About Anger_


_Myth #1: Anger Is Inherited._ One misconception or myth about anger is that the way we
express anger is inherited and cannot be changed. Sometimes, we may hear someone say, “I
inherited my anger from my father; that’s just the way I am.” This statement implies that the
expression of anger is a fixed and unalterable set of behaviors. Evidence from research stud­
ies, however, indicates that people are not born with set, specific ways of expressing anger.
These studies show, rather, that because the expression of anger is learned behavior, more
appropriate ways of expressing anger also can be learned.


It is well established that much of people’s behavior is learned by observing others, particularly
influential people. These people include parents, family members, and friends. If children
observe parents expressing anger through aggressive acts, such as verbal abuse and violence,
it is very likely that they will learn to express anger in similar ways. Fortunately, this behavior
can be changed by learning new and appropriate ways of anger expression. It is not necessary
to continue to express anger by aggressive and violent means.


_Myth #2: Anger Automatically Leads to Aggression._ A related myth involves the misconception
that the only effective way to express anger is through aggression. It is commonly thought that
anger is something that builds and escalates to the point of an aggressive outburst. As has
been said, however, anger does not necessarily lead to aggression. In fact, effective anger man­
agement involves controlling the escalation of anger by learning assertiveness skills, changing
negative and hostile “self-talk,” challenging irrational beliefs, and employing a variety of behav­
ioral strategies. These skills, techniques, and strategies will be discussed in later sessions.


_Myth #3: People Must Be Aggressive To Get What They Want._ Many people confuse assertive­
ness with aggression. The goal of aggression is to dominate, intimidate, harm, or injure another
person—to win at any cost. Conversely, the goal of assertiveness is to express feelings of anger

# _10_


_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


in a way that is respectful of other people. For example, if you were upset because a friend was
repeatedly late for meetings, you could respond by shouting obscenities and name-calling. This
approach is an attack on the other person rather than an attempt to address the behavior that
you find frustrating or anger provoking.


An assertive way of handling this situation might be to say, “When you are late for a meeting
with me, I get pretty frustrated. I wish that you would be on time more often.” This statement
expresses your feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction and communicates how you would
like the situation changed. This expression does not blame or threaten the other person and
minimizes the chance of causing emotional harm. We will discuss assertiveness skills in more
detail in sessions 7 and 8.


_Myth #4: Venting Anger Is Always Desirable._ For many years, the popular belief among numer­
ous mental health professionals and laymen was that the aggressive expression of anger, such
as screaming or beating on pillows, was healthy and therapeutic. Research studies have found,
however, that people who vent their anger aggressively simply get better at being angry
(Berkowitz, 1970; Murray, 1985; Straus, Gelles, & Steinmetz, 1980). In other words, venting
anger in an aggressive manner reinforces aggressive behavior.


_Anger as a Habitual Response_


Not only is the expression of anger learned, but it can become a routine, familiar, and pre­
dictable response to a variety of situations. When anger is displayed frequently and aggressive­
ly, it can become a maladaptive habit because it results in negative consequences. Habits, by
definition, are performed over and over again, without thinking. People with anger manage­
ment problems often resort to aggressive displays of anger to solve their problems, without
thinking about the negative consequences they may suffer or the debilitating effects it may
have on the people around them.


_Breaking the Anger Habit_


_Becoming Aware of Anger._ To break the anger habit, you must develop an awareness of the
events, circumstances, and behaviors of others that “trigger” your anger. This awareness also
involves understanding the negative consequences that result from anger. For example, you may
be in line at the supermarket and become impatient because the lines are too long. You could
become angry, then boisterously demand that the checkout clerk call for more help. As your
anger escalates, you may become involved in a heated exchange with the clerk or another cus­
tomer. The store manager may respond by having a security officer remove you from the store.
The negative consequences that result from this event are not getting the groceries that you
wanted and the embarrassment and humiliation you suffer from being removed from the store.


_Strategies for Controlling Anger._ In addition to becoming aware of anger, you need to develop
strategies to effectively manage it. These strategies can be used to stop the escalation of
anger before you lose control and experience negative consequences. An effective set of
strategies for controlling anger should include both immediate and preventive strategies.
# _11_


Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


Immediate strategies include taking a timeout, deep-breathing exercises, and thought stopping.
Preventive strategies include developing an exercise program and changing your irrational
beliefs. These strategies will be discussed in more detail in later sessions.


One example of an immediate anger management strategy worth exploring at this point is the
timeout. The timeout can be used formally or informally. For now, we will only describe the
informal use of a timeout. This use involves leaving a situation if you feel your anger is escalat­
ing out of control. For example, you may be a passenger on a crowded bus and become angry
because you perceive that people are deliberately bumping into you. In this situation, you can
simply get off the bus and wait for a less crowded bus.


The informal use of a timeout may also involve stopping yourself from engaging in a discussion
or argument if you feel that you are becoming too angry. In these situations, it may be helpful
to actually call a timeout or to give the timeout sign with your hands. This lets the other person
know that you wish to immediately stop talking about the topic and are becoming frustrated,
upset, or angry.


In this group, you should call a timeout if you feel that your anger is escalating out of control.
You also are encouraged to leave the room for a short period of time if you feel that you need
to do so. However, please come back for the remainder of the group session after you have
calmed down.


_Participant Introductions_


At this point, ask group members to give their names, the reasons they are interested in partic­
ipating in the anger management group, and what they hope to achieve in the group. After
each member’s introduction, offer a supportive comment that validates his or her decision to
participate in the group. Experience shows that this helps members feel the group will meet
their needs and helps reduce the anxiety associated with the introductions and the first group
session in general.


_Anger Meter_


One technique that is helpful in increasing the awareness of anger is learning to monitor it. A
simple way to monitor anger is to use the “anger meter.” A 1 on the anger meter represents a
complete lack of anger or a total state of calm, whereas a 10 represents a very angry and
explosive loss of control that leads to negative consequences. Points between 1 and 10 repre­
sent feelings of anger between these extremes. The purpose of the anger meter is to monitor
the escalation of anger as it moves up the scale. For example, when a person encounters an
anger-provoking event, he or she does not reach a 10 immediately, although it may sometimes
feel that way. In reality, the individual’s anger starts at a low number and rapidly moves up the
scale. There is always time, provided one has learned effective coping skills, to stop anger from
escalating to a 10.

# _12_


_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


One difficulty people have when learning to use the anger meter is misunderstanding the
meaning of a 10. A 10 is reserved for instances when an individual suffers (or could suffer)
negative consequences. An example is when an individual assaults another person and is
arrested by the police.


A second point to make about the anger meter is that people may interpret the numbers on
the scale differently. These differences are acceptable. What may be a 5 for one person may
be a 7 for someone else. It is much more important to personalize the anger meter and
become comfortable and familiar with your readings of the numbers on the scale. For the
group, however, a 10 is reserved for instances when someone loses control and suffers (or
could suffer) negative consequences.

and the cues that indicate an escalation of anger.

- Cues to Anger




- Explaining the Check-In
Procedure




- Homework Assignment



After the Check-In Procedure, ask group members to list specific events that trigger their anger.
Pay special attention to helping them distinguish between the events and their interpretation of
these events. Events refer to facts. Interpretations refer to opinions, value judgments, or per­
ceptions of the events. For example, a group member might say, “My boss criticized me
because he doesn’t like me.” Point out that the specific event was that the boss criticized the
group member and that the belief that his boss doesn’t like him is an interpretation that may
or may not be accurate.


Be aware of gender differences. Women participants often identify relationships with their
boyfriend or partner or parenting concerns as events that trigger their anger. Men, however,
may rarely identify these issues as triggers.


Finally, present the four cues to anger categories. After describing each category, ask group
members to provide examples. It is important to emphasize that cues may be different for each
individual. Members should identify cues that indicate an escalation of their anger.

# _15_


Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


Suggested Remarks
_(Use the following script or put this in your own words.)_


_Events That Trigger Anger_


When you get angry, it is because an event has provoked your anger. For example, you may
get angry when the bus is late, when you have to wait in line at the grocery store, or when a
neighbor plays his stereo too loud. Everyday events such as these can provoke your anger.


Many times, specific events touch on sensitive areas in your life. These sensitive areas or “red
flags” usually refer to long-standing issues that can easily lead to anger. For example, some of
us may have been slow readers as children and may have been sensitive about our reading
ability. Although we may read well now as adults, we may continue to be sensitive about this
issue. This sensitivity may be revealed when someone rushes us while we are completing an
application or reviewing a memorandum and may trigger anger because we may feel that we
are being criticized or judged as we were when we were children. This sensitivity may also
show itself in a more direct way, such as when someone calls us “slow” or “stupid.”


In addition to events experienced in the here-and-now, you may also recall an event from
your past that made you angry. You might remember, for example, how the bus always seemed
to be late before you left home for an important appointment. Just thinking about how late
the bus was in the past can make you angry in the present. Another example may be when
you recall a situation involving a family member who betrayed or hurt you in some way.
Remembering this situation, or this family member, can raise your number on the anger
meter. Here are examples of events or issues that can trigger anger:


  - Long waits to see your doctor


  - Traffic congestion


  - Crowded buses


  - A friend joking about a sensitive topic


  - A friend not paying back money owed to you


  - Being wrongly accused


  - Having to clean up someone else’s mess


  - Having an untidy roommate


  - Having a neighbor who plays the stereo too loud


  - Being placed on hold for long periods of time while on the telephone


  - Being given wrong directions

# _16_


_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


- Rumors being spread about your relapse that are not true


- Having money or property stolen from you.


_Cues to Anger_


A second important aspect of anger monitoring is to identify the cues that occur in response to
the anger-provoking event. These cues serve as warning signs that you have become angry and
that your anger is continuing to escalate. They can be broken down into four cue categories:
physical, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive (or thought) cues.


_Physical Cues._ Physical cues involve the way our bodies respond when we become angry. For
example, our heart rates may increase, we may feel tightness in our chests, or we may feel hot
and flushed. These physical cues can also warn us that our anger is escalating out of control
or approaching a 10 on the anger meter. We can learn to identify these cues when they occur
in response to an anger-provoking event.


Can you identify some of the physical cues that you have experi­
enced when you have become angry?


_Behavioral Cues._ Behavioral cues involve the behaviors we display when we get angry, which
are observed by other people around us. For example, we may clench our fists, pace back and
forth, slam a door, or raise our voices. These behavioral responses are the second cue of our
anger. As with physical cues, they are warning signs that we may be approaching a 10 on the
anger meter.


What are some of the behavioral cues that you have experienced
when you have become angry?


_Emotional Cues._ Emotional cues involve other feelings that may occur concurrently with our
anger. For example, we may become angry when we feel abandoned, afraid, discounted, disre­
spected, guilty, humiliated, impatient, insecure, jealous, or rejected. These kinds of feelings are
the core or primary feelings that underlie our anger. It is easy to discount these primary feel­
ings because they often make us feel vulnerable. An important component of anger manage­
ment is to become aware of, and to recognize, the primary feelings that underlie our anger. In
this group, we will view anger as a secondary emotion to these more primary feelings.


Can you identify some of the primary feelings that you have experi­
enced during an episode of anger?


_Cognitive Cues._ Cognitive cues refer to the thoughts that occur in response to the angerprovoking event. When people become angry, they may interpret events in certain ways. For
example, we may interpret a friend’s comments as criticism, or we may interpret the actions
of others as demeaning, humiliating, or controlling. Some people call these thoughts “self-talk”
because they resemble a conversation we are having with ourselves. For people with anger

# _17_


Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


problems, this self-talk is usually very critical and hostile in tone and content. It reflects beliefs
about the way they think the world should be; beliefs about people, places, and things.


Closely related to thoughts and self-talk are fantasies and images. We view fantasies and
images as other types of cognitive cues that can indicate an escalation of anger. For example,
we might fantasize about seeking revenge on a perceived enemy or imagine or visualize our
spouse having an affair. When we have these fantasies and images, our anger can escalate
even more rapidly.


Can you think of other examples of cognitive or thought cues?


Explaining the Check-In Procedure


In this session, group members began to monitor their anger and identify anger-provoking
events and situations. In each weekly session, there will be a Check-In Procedure to follow up
on the homework assignment from the previous week and to report the highest level of anger
reached on the anger meter during the week.


Have participants identify the event that triggered their anger, the cues that were associated
with their anger, and the strategies they used to manage their anger in response to the event.
They will be using the following questions to check in at the beginning of each session:


1. What was the highest number you reached on the anger meter during the past week?


2. What was the event that triggered your anger?


3. What cues were associated with the anger-provoking event? For example, what were the
physical, behavioral, emotional, or cognitive cues?


4. What strategies did you use to avoid reaching 10 on the anger meter?


They will also be asked to monitor and record the highest number they reach on the anger
meter for each day of the upcoming week after each session.


Exhibit 2. Cues to Anger: Four Cue Categories


1. Physical (examples: rapid heartbeat, tightness in chest, feeling hot or
flushed)


2. Behavioral (examples: pacing, clenching fists, raising voice, staring)


3. Emotional (examples: fear, hurt, jealousy, guilt)


4. Cognitive/Thoughts (examples: hostile self-talk, images of aggression
and revenge)

repertoire of strategies is called an anger control
plan. This plan should consist of _immediate_ strategies, those that can be used in the heat of
the moment when anger is rapidly escalating, and _preventive_ strategies, those that can be
used to avoid escalation of anger before it begins. It is important to encourage members to
use strategies that work best for them. Some find cognitive restructuring (e.g., challenging hos­
tile self-talk or irrational beliefs) very effective. Others might prefer using strategies such as a
timeout or thought stopping. The main point is to help group members individualize their anger
control plans and to help them develop strategies that they are comfortable with and that they
will readily use. In the remaining sessions, you will continue to help group members develop
effective strategies for controlling their anger and clarify and reinforce these strategies during
the Check-In Procedure.

Participants should be encouraged to seek support and feedback from people they can trust to
support their recovery, including anger management strategies that will de-escalate, rather
than escalate, the situation. Participants should seek advice from one another and other
patients who are in recovery and from members in support networks, including members of
12-Step groups, 12-Step sponsors, or religious group members.


In addition to helping group members begin to develop their anger control plans, start the ses­
sion with the Check-In Procedure, and end the session with a breathing exercise as a form of
relaxation training. Before leading members in the breathing exercise, ask whether anyone has
had experience with different forms of relaxation. Describe the continuum of relaxation tech­
niques, which can range from simple breathing exercises to elaborate guided imagery. Explain
that in the group, they will practice two short and simple relaxation exercises, deep-breathing

# _21_

and progressive muscle relaxation. Further explain that experience shows that group members
are more likely to use these simple forms of relaxation.


Check-In Procedure


Ask group members to report the highest level of anger they reached on the anger meter
during the past week. Make sure they reserve the number 10 for situations where they lost
control of their anger and experienced negative consequences. Ask them to describe the
anger-provoking event that led to their highest level of anger. Help them identify the cues that
occurred in response to the anger-provoking event, and help them classify these cues into the
four cue categories.

_Anger Control Plans_


Up to this point, you have been focusing on how to monitor your anger. In the first session, you
learned how to use the anger meter to rate your anger. Last week, you learned how to identify
the events that trigger anger, as well as the physical, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive cues
associated with each event. Today, you will begin to discuss how to develop an anger control
plan and how you can use specific strategies, such as timeouts and relaxation, to control your
anger. In later sessions, you will cover other strategies, such as learning to change negative or
hostile self-talk and using the Conflict Resolution Model (see page 39). These more advanced
strategies can be used along with timeouts and relaxation.
# _22_


_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


The basic idea in developing an anger control plan is to try many different strategies and find
the anger control techniques that work best for you. Once you identify these strategies, you can
add them to your anger control plans and use them when you start to get angry. Some people
refer to their anger control plans as their toolbox and the specific strategies they use to control
their anger as their tools. This analogy may be very helpful. Again, it is important to identify the
specific anger control strategies that work best for you. These strategies should be put down in
a formal anger control plan for referral when you encounter an anger-provoking event.


An effective strategy that many people use, for example, is to talk about their feelings with a
supportive friend who was not involved with the event that made them angry. By discussing
anger, you can begin to identify the primary emotions that underlie it and determine whether
your thinking and expectations in response to the anger-provoking event are rational. Often a
friend whom you trust can provide a different perspective on what is going on in your life. Even
if your friend just listens, expressing your feelings can often make you feel better.


The long-term objective of the anger management treatment is to develop a set of strategies
that you can use appropriately for specific anger-provoking events. Later sessions will introduce
a menu of strategies and techniques that are helpful in managing anger. Once you have select­
ed the strategies that work best, you should refine them by applying them in real-life situations.
To use the toolbox analogy, different tools may be needed for different situations. We will
return to this concept in later sessions and highlight the importance of developing an anger
control plan that helps you manage anger effectively in a variety of situations.


_Timeout._ As mentioned in session 1, the concept of a timeout is especially important to anger
management. It is the basic anger management strategy recommended for inclusion in every­
one’s anger control plan. Informally, a timeout is defined as leaving the situation that is caus­
ing the escalation of anger or simply stopping the discussion that is provoking it.


Formally, a timeout involves relationships with other people: it involves an agreement or a pre­
arranged plan. These relationships may involve family members, friends, and coworkers. Any of
the parties involved may call a timeout in accordance with rules that have been agreed on by
everyone in advance. The person calling the timeout can leave the situation, if necessary. It is
agreed, however, that he or she will return to either finish the discussion or postpone it,
depending on whether all those involved feel they can successfully resolve the issue.


Timeouts are important because they can be effective in the heat of the moment. Even if your
anger is escalating quickly on the anger meter, you can prevent reaching 10 by taking a timeout and leaving the situation.


Timeouts are also effective when they are used with other strategies. For example, you can
take a timeout and go for a walk. You can also take a timeout and call a trusted friend or fami­
ly member or write in your journal. These other strategies should help you calm down during
the timeout period.


Can you think of specific strategies that you might use to control
your anger?


Should these strategies be included on your anger control plan?

_Relaxation Through Breathing_


We have discussed the physical cues to anger, such as an increased heartbeat, feeling hot or
flushed, or muscle tension. These types of physical cues are examples of what is commonly
called the stress response. In the stress response, the nervous system is energized, and in this
agitated state, a person is likely to have trouble returning to lower levels on the anger meter. In
this state, additional anger-provoking situations and events are likely to cause a further escala­
tion of anger.


An interesting aspect of the nervous system is that everyone has a relaxation response that
counteracts the stress response. It is physically impossible to be both agitated and relaxed at
the same time. If you can relax successfully, you can counteract the stress or anger response.


We will end this session by practicing a deep-breathing exercise as a relaxation technique. In
session 4, we will practice progressive muscle relaxation as a secondary type of relaxation
technique.

# _24_

Note to Group Leader:
_Lead a Breathing Exercise_

_(Use this script or put this in your own words.)_


Get comfortable in your chair. If you like, close your eyes; or just gaze at the floor.


Take a few moments to settle yourself. Now make yourself aware of your body. Check your
body for tension, beginning with your feet, and scan upward to your head. Notice any ten­
sion you might have in your legs, your stomach, your hands and arms, your shoulders,
your neck, and your face. Try to let go of the tension you are feeling.


Now, make yourself aware of your breathing. Pay attention to your breath as it enters and
leaves your body. This can be very relaxing.


Let’s all take a deep breath together. Notice your lungs and chest expanding. Now slowly
exhale through your nose. Again, take a deep breath. Fill your lungs and chest. Notice how
much air you can take in. Hold it for a second. Now release it and slowly exhale. One more
time, inhale slowly and fully. Hold it for a second, and release.


Now on your own, continue breathing in this way for another couple of minutes. Continue
to focus on your breathing. With each inhalation and exhalation, feel your body becoming
more and more relaxed. Use your breathing to wash away any remaining tension.


_(Allow group members to practice breathing for 1 to 2 minutes in silence.)_


Now let’s take another deep breath. Inhale fully, hold it for a second, and release. Inhale
again, hold, and release. Continue to be aware of your breath as it fills your lungs. Once
more, inhale fully, hold it for a second, and release.


When you feel ready, open your eyes.


How was that? Did you notice any new sensations while you were breathing? How do you
feel now?


This breathing exercise can be shortened to just three deep inhalations and exhalations.
Even that much can be effective in helping you relax when your anger is escalating. You
can practice this at home, at work, on the bus, while waiting for an appointment, or even
while walking. The key to making deep-breathing an effective relaxation technique is to
practice it frequently and to apply it in a variety of situations.

End the session by presenting a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. Progressive muscle
relaxation is another technique that has been effective in reducing anger levels. An alternative
to the deep-breathing exercise introduced in last week’s session, it is straightforward and easy
to learn.


Check-In Procedure


Ask group members to report the highest level of anger they reached on the anger meter
during the past week. Make sure they reserve the number 10 for situations where they lost
control of their anger and experienced negative consequences. Ask them to describe the
anger-provoking event that led to their highest level of anger. Help them identify the cues that
occurred in response to the anger-provoking event, and help them classify those cues into the
four cue categories. Include, as part of the Check-In Procedure, a followup on the homework
assignment from the previous week’s session. Ask participants to report on the specific anger
management strategies listed, thus far, on their anger control plans. In addition, inquire
whether they practiced the deep-breathing exercise that was introduced in last week’s session.

# _27_


Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


Suggested Remarks

_(Use the following script or put this in your own words.)_


_The Aggression Cycle_


In the last three sessions, we reviewed the anger meter, cues to anger, and the anger control
plan; in this session, the framework for integrating these anger management concepts is pre­
sented. This framework is the aggression cycle.


From an anger management perspective, an episode of anger can be viewed as consisting of
three phases: _escalation, explosion,_ and _postexplosion_ . Together, they make up the aggression
cycle. In this process, the escalation phase is characterized by cues that indicate anger is
building. As stated in session 2, these cues can be physical, behavioral, emotional, or cognitive
(thoughts). As you may recall, cues are warning signs, or responses, to anger-provoking events.
Events, on the other hand, are situations that occur every day that may lead to escalations of
anger if effective anger management strategies are not used. Red-flag events are types of situ­
ations that are unique to you and that you are especially sensitive to because of past events.
These events can involve internal processes (e.g., thinking about situations that were anger
provoking in the past) or external processes (e.g., experiencing real-life, anger-provoking situa­
tions in the here and now).


If the escalation phase is allowed to continue, the explosion phase will follow. The explosion
phase is marked by an uncontrollable discharge of anger displayed as verbal or physical
aggression. This discharge, in turn, leads to negative consequences; it is synonymous with the
number 10 on the anger meter.


The final stage of the aggression cycle is the postexplosion phase. It is characterized by nega­
tive consequences resulting from the verbal or physical aggression displayed during the explo­
sion phase. These consequences may include going to jail, making restitution, being terminat­
ed from a job or discharged from a drug treatment or social service program, losing family and
loved ones, or feelings of guilt, shame, and regret.


The intensity, frequency, and duration of anger in the aggression cycle varies among individu­
als. For example, one person’s anger may escalate rapidly after a provocative event and, within
just a few minutes, reach the explosion phase. Another person’s anger may escalate slowly but
steadily over several hours before reaching the explosion phase. Similarly, one person may
experience more episodes of anger and progress through the aggression cycle more often than
the other. However, both individuals, despite differences in how quickly their anger escalates
and how frequently they experience anger, will undergo all three phases of the aggression
cycle.


The intensity of these individuals’ anger also may differ. One person may engage in more vio­
lent behavior than the other in the explosion phase. For example, he or she may use weapons
or assault someone. The other person may express his or her anger during the explosion phase

# _28_


_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


by shouting at or threatening other people. Regardless of these individual differences,
the explosion phase is synonymous with losing control and becoming verbally or physically
aggressive.


Notice that the escalation and explosion phases of the aggression cycle correspond to the lev­
els on the anger meter. The points below 10 on the anger meter represent the escalation
phase, the building up of anger. The explosion phase, on the other hand, corresponds to 10 on
the anger meter. Again 10 on the anger meter is the point at which one loses control and
expresses anger through verbal or physical aggression that leads to negative consequences.


One of the primary objectives of anger management treatment is to keep from reaching the
explosion phase. This is accomplished by using the anger meter to monitor changes in your
anger, attending to the cues or warning signs that indicate anger is building, and employing the
appropriate strategies from your anger control plans to stop the escalation of anger. If the
explosion phase is prevented from occurring, the postexplosion phase will not occur, and the
aggression cycle will be broken. If you use your anger control plans effectively, your anger
should ideally reach between a 1 and a 9 on the anger meter. This is a reasonable goal to aim
for. By preventing the explosion phase (10), you will not experience the negative consequences
of the postexplosion phase, and you will break the cycle of aggression.

Note to Group Leader:
_Lead a Progressive Muscle Relaxation Exercise_


_(Use this script or put this in your own words.)_


Last week you practiced deep-breathing as a relaxation technique. Today I will introduce
progressive muscle relaxation. Start by getting comfortable in your chairs. Close your eyes
if you like. Take a moment to really settle in. Now, as you did last week, begin to focus on
your breathing. Take a deep breath. Hold it for a second. Now exhale fully and completely.
Again, take a deep breath. Fill your lungs and chest. Now release and exhale slowly.
Again, one more time, inhale slowly, hold, and release.


Now, while you continue to breathe deeply and fully, bring your awareness to your hands.
Clench your fists very tightly. Hold that tension. Now relax your fists, letting your fingers
unfold and letting your hands completely relax. Again, clench your fists tightly. Hold and
release the tension. Imagine all the tension being released from your hands down to your
fingertips. Notice the difference between the tension and complete relaxation.


Now bring your awareness to your arms. Curl your arms as if you are doing a bicep curl.
Tense your fists, forearms, and biceps. Hold the tension and release it. Let the tension in
your arms unfold and your hands float back to your thighs. Feel the tension drain out of
your arms. Again, curl your arms to tighten your biceps. Notice the tension, hold, and
release. Let the tension flow out of your arms. Replace it with deep muscle relaxation.


Now raise your shoulders toward your ears. Really tense your shoulders. Hold them up for a
second. Gently drop your shoulders, and release all the tension. Again, lift your shoulders,
hold the tension, and release. Let the tension flow from your shoulders all the way down
your arms to your fingers. Notice how different your muscles feel when they are relaxed.


Now bring your awareness to your neck and face. Tense all those muscles by making a
face. Tense your neck, jaw, and forehead. Hold the tension, and release. Let the muscles
of your neck and jaw relax. Relax all the lines in your forehead. One final time, tense all
the muscles in your neck and face, hold, and release. Be aware of your muscles relaxing
at the top of your head and around your eyes. Let your eyes relax in their sockets, almost
as if they were sinking into the back of your head. Relax your jaw and your throat. Relax
all the muscles around your ears. Feel all the tension in your neck muscles release.


Now just sit for a few moments. Scan your body for any tension and release it. Notice how
your body feels when your muscles are completely relaxed.


When you are ready, open your eyes. How was that? Did you notice any new sensations?
How does your body feel now? How about your state of mind? Do you notice any
difference now from when we started?

management technique that requires group
members to examine and change their thought
processes. People differ in their ability to learn and apply these techniques. Some may be
generally familiar with cognitive restructuring, whereas others may have little or no experience
with this concept. In addition, some people may initially have difficulty understanding the con­
cept or may not yet be ready to challenge or change their irrational beliefs. It is important to
accept these group members, whatever their level of readiness and understanding, and help
them identify how their irrational beliefs perpetuate anger and how modifying these beliefs can
prevent further escalation of anger.

- Thought Stopping




- Homework Assignment



In addition to presenting the A-B-C-D Model, include a discussion on thought stopping. Thought
stopping is accepted and readily understood by most clients. Regardless of whether they view
particular beliefs as irrational or maladaptive, most people recognize that these specific beliefs
increase anger and lead to the explosion phase (10 on the anger meter). Thought stopping
provides an immediate and direct strategy for helping people manage the beliefs that cause
their anger to escalate.


Check-In Procedure


Ask group members to report the highest level of anger they reached on the anger meter
during the past week. Make sure they reserve 10 for situations where they lost control of their
anger and experienced negative consequences. Ask them to describe the anger-provoking
event that led to their highest level of anger and to identify the cues that occurred in response
to the anger-provoking event. Help them classify these cues into the four cue categories.
Include, as part of the Check-In Procedure, a followup of the homework assignment from last
week’s session. Specifically ask group members to report on the development of their anger
control plans. In addition, inquire whether they practiced the progressive muscle relaxation
exercise.

**Anger** **Management** _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


Suggested Remarks

_(Use the following script or put this in your own words.)_


_The A-B-C-D Model_


Albert Ellis developed a model that is consistent with the way we conceptualize anger manage­
ment treatment. He calls his model the A-B-C-D or rational-emotive model. In this model, _“A”_
_stands for an activating event_, what we have been calling the red-flag event. _“B” represents the_
_beliefs_ people have about the activating event. Ellis claims that it is not the events themselves
that produce feelings such as anger, but our interpretations of and beliefs about the events.
_“C” stands for the emotional consequences of events_ . In other words, these are the feelings
people experience as a result of their interpretations of and beliefs concerning the event.


According to Ellis and other cognitive behavioral theorists, as people become angry, they
engage in an internal dialog, called “self-talk.” For example, suppose you were waiting for a
bus to arrive. As it approaches, several people push in front of you to board. In this situation,
you may start to get angry. You may be thinking, “How can people be so inconsiderate! They
just push me aside to get on the bus. They obviously don’t care about me or other people.”
Examples of the irrational self-talk that can produce anger escalation are reflected in state­
ments such as “People should be more considerate of my feelings,” “How dare they be so
inconsiderate and disrespectful,” and “They obviously don’t care about anyone but themselves.”


Ellis says that people do not have to get angry when they encounter such an event. The event
itself does not get them upset and angry; rather, it is people’s interpretations of and beliefs
concerning the event that cause the anger. Beliefs underlying anger often take the form of
“should” and “must.” Most of us may agree, for example, that respecting others is an
admirable quality. Our belief might be, “People should always respect others.” In reality, how­
ever, people often do not respect each other in everyday encounters. You can choose to view
the situation more realistically as an unfortunate defect of human beings, or you can let your
anger escalate every time you witness, or are the recipient of, another person’s disrespect.
Unfortunately, your perceived disrespect will keep you angry and push you toward the explosion
phase. Ironically, it may even lead you to show disrespect to others, which would violate your
own fundamental belief about how people should be treated.


Ellis’ approach consists of identifying irrational beliefs and disputing them with more rational
or realistic perspectives (in Ellis’ model, _“D” stands for dispute_ ). You may get angry, for exam­
ple, when you start thinking, “I must always be in control. I must control every situation.” It is
not possible or appropriate, however, to control every situation. Rather than continue with
these beliefs, you can try to dispute them. You might tell yourself, “I have no power over things
I cannot control,” or “I have to accept what I cannot change.” These are examples of ways to
dispute beliefs that you may have already encountered in 12-Step programs such as Alcoholics
Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.


People may have many other irrational beliefs that may lead to anger. Consider an example
where a friend of yours disagrees with you. You may start to think, “Everyone must like me and

# _34_


_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


give me approval.” If you hold such a belief, you are likely to get upset and angry when you
face rejection. However, if you dispute this irrational belief by saying, “I can’t please everyone;
some people are not going to approve of everything I do,” you will most likely start to calm
down and be able to control your anger more easily.


Another common irrational belief is, “I must be respected and treated fairly by everyone.” This
also is likely to lead to frustration and anger. Most folks, for example, live in an urban society
where they may, at times, not be given the common courtesy they expect. This is unfortunate,
but from an anger management perspective, it is better to accept the unfairness and lack of
interpersonal connectedness that can result from living in an urban society. Thus, to dispute
this belief, it is helpful to tell yourself, “I can’t be expected to be treated fairly by everyone.”


Other beliefs that may lead to anger include “Everyone should follow the rules,” or “Life should
be fair,” or “Good should prevail over evil,” or “People should always do the right thing.” These
are beliefs that are not always followed by everyone in society, and, usually, there is little you
can do to change that. How might you dispute these beliefs? In other words, what thoughts
that are more rational and adaptive and will not lead to anger can be substituted for such
beliefs?


For people with anger control problems, these irrational beliefs can lead to the explosion phase
(10 on the anger meter) and to the negative consequences of the postexplosion phase. It is
often better to change your outlook by disputing your beliefs and creating an internal dialog or
self-talk that is more rational and adaptive.

Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


_Thought Stopping_


A second approach to controlling anger is called thought stopping. It provides an immediate
and direct alternative to the A-B-C-D Model. In this approach, you simply tell yourself (through a
series of self-commands) to _stop_ thinking the thoughts that are getting you angry. For example,
you might tell yourself, “I need to _stop_ thinking these thoughts. I will only get into trouble if I
keep thinking this way,” or “Don’t buy into this situation,” or “Don’t go there.” In other words,
instead of trying to dispute your thoughts and beliefs as outlined in the A-B-C-D Model
described above, the goal is to stop your current pattern of angry thoughts before they lead to
an escalation of anger and loss of control.


Homework Assignment


Have group members refer to the participant workbook. Ask them to monitor and record their
highest level of anger on the anger meter during the coming week. Ask them to identify the
event that made them angry, the cues that were associated with the anger-provoking event,
and the strategies they used to manage their anger in response to the event. Ask members to
review the A-B-C-D Model and to record at least two irrational beliefs and how they would dis­
pute these beliefs. In addition, instruct them to use the thought-stopping technique, preferably
once a day during the coming week. Remind them to continue to develop their anger control
plans.

##### **Assertiveness Training and the** **Conflict Resolution Model** _Alternatives for Expressing Anger_


###### Sessions 7 & 8

Sessions 7 and 8 are combined because it takes
more than one session to adequately address
assertiveness, aggression, passivity, and the
Conflict Resolution Model.

                       - Homework Assignment

Assertiveness is such a fundamental skill in inter­
personal interactions and anger management that
the group will spend 2 weeks developing and practicing
this concept. These two 90-minute sessions will present an introduction to assertiveness train­
ing. The majority of this week’s session will be spent reviewing the definitions of assertiveness,
aggression, and passivity and presenting the Conflict Resolution Model. The Conflict Resolution
Model is an assertive device for resolving conflicts with others. It consists of a series of prob­
lem solving steps that, when followed closely, minimize the potential for anger escalation. Next
week’s session, in contrast, will focus on group members roleplaying real-life situations using
the Conflict Resolution Model. It is important to emphasize that assertive, aggressive, and pas­
sive responses are learned behaviors and not innate, unchangeable traits. The goal of these
two sessions is to teach members how to use the Conflict Resolution Model to develop
assertive responses rather than aggressive or passive responses.


Check-In Procedure


Ask group members to report the highest level of anger they reached on the anger meter dur­
ing the past week. Make sure they reserve 10 for situations where they lost control of their
anger and experienced negative consequences. Ask them to describe the anger-provoking
event that led to their highest level of anger. Help them identify the cues that occurred in
response to the anger-provoking event, and help them classify these cues into the four cue cat­
egories. Ask members to report on the ongoing development of their anger control plans.

_Assertiveness Training_


Sessions 7 and 8 provide an introduction to assertiveness training and the Conflict Resolution
Model. Assertiveness involves a set of behaviors and skills that require time and practice to
learn and master. In this group, we focus on one important aspect of assertiveness training,
that is, conflict resolution. The Conflict Resolution Model can be particularly effective for help­
ing individuals manage their anger.


Many interpersonal conflicts occur when you feel that your rights have been violated. Before
entering anger management treatment, you may have tended to respond with aggressive
behavior when you believed that another person showed you disrespect or violated your rights.
In today’s session, we will discuss several ways to resolve interpersonal conflicts without
resorting to aggression.


As we discussed in session 1, aggression is _behavior_ that is intended to cause harm or injury to
another person or damage property. This behavior can include verbal abuse, threats, or violent
acts. Often, when another person has violated your rights, your first reaction is to fight back or
retaliate. The basic message of aggression is that my feelings, thoughts, and beliefs are impor­
tant and that your feelings, thoughts, and beliefs are unimportant and inconsequential.


One alternative to using aggressive behavior is to act passively or in a nonassertive manner.
Acting in a passive or nonassertive way is undesirable because you allow your rights to be vio­
lated. You may resent the person who violated your rights, and you may also be angry with
yourself for not standing up for your rights. In addition, it is likely that you will become even
more angry the next time you encounter this person. The basic message of passivity is that
_your_ feelings, thoughts, and beliefs are important, but _my_ feelings, thoughts, and beliefs are
unimportant and inconsequential. Acting in a passive or nonassertive way may help you avoid
the negative consequences associated with aggression, but it may also ultimately lead to nega­
tive personal consequences, such as diminished self-esteem, and prevent you from having
your needs satisfied.


From an anger management perspective, the best way to deal with a person who has violated
your rights is to act assertively. Acting assertively involves standing up for your rights in a way that
is respectful of other people. The basic message of assertiveness is that my feelings, thoughts,
and beliefs are important, and that your feelings, thoughts, and beliefs are equally important. By
acting assertively, you can express your feelings, thoughts, and beliefs to the person who violated
your rights without suffering the negative consequences associated with aggression or the devalu­
ation of your feelings, which is associated with passivity or nonassertion.


It is important to emphasize that assertive, aggressive, and passive responses are learned
behaviors; they are not innate, unchangeable traits. Using the Conflict Resolution Model, you
can learn to develop assertive responses that allow you to manage interpersonal conflicts in a
more effective way.
# _40_


_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


In summary, aggression involves expressing feelings, thoughts, and beliefs in a harmful and
disrespectful way. Passivity or nonassertiveness involves failing to express feelings, thoughts,
and beliefs or expressing them in an apologetic manner that others can easily disregard.
Assertiveness involves standing up for your rights and expressing feelings, thoughts, and
beliefs in direct, honest, and appropriate ways that do not violate the rights of others or show
disrespect.


It is helpful to think of real-life situations to help you understand what is meant by assertive­
ness. Suppose you have been attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting several times a
week with a friend. Suppose you have been driving your friend to these meetings for several
weeks. In the last few days, however, he has not been ready when you have come to pick him
up. His tardiness has resulted in both of you being late for meetings. Because you value being
on time, this is something that bothers you a great deal. Consider the different ways you might
act in this situation. You can behave in an aggressive manner by yelling at your friend for being
late and refusing to pick him up in the future. The disadvantage of this response is that he may
no longer want to continue the friendship. Another response would be to act passively, or in a
nonassertive fashion, by ignoring the problem and not expressing how you feel. The disadvan­
tage of this response is that the problem will most likely continue and that this will inevitably
lead to feelings of resentment toward your friend. Again, from an anger management perspec­
tive, the best way to deal with this problem is to act assertively by expressing your feelings,
thoughts, and beliefs in a direct and honest manner, while respecting the rights of your friend.


_Conflict Resolution Model_


One method of acting assertively is to use the Conflict Resolution Model, which involves five
steps that can easily be memorized. The first step involves _identifying the problem_ that is caus­
ing the conflict. It is important to be specific when identifying the problem. In this example, the
problem causing the conflict is that your friend is late. The second step involves _identifying the_
_feelings_ associated with the conflict. In this example, you may feel annoyance, frustration, or
taken for granted. The third step involves _identifying the specific impact_ of the problem that is
causing the conflict. In this example, the impact or outcome is that you are late for the meet­
ing. The fourth step involves _deciding whether to resolve the conflict_ or let it go. This may best
be phrased by the questions, “Is the conflict important enough to bring up? If I do not try to
resolve this issue, will it lead to feelings of anger and resentment?” If you decide that the con­
flict is important enough, then the fifth step is necessary. The fifth step is to _address and_
_resolve the conflict_ . This involves checking out the schedule of the other person. The schedule
is important because you might bring up the conflict when the other person does not have the
time to address it or when he or she may be preoccupied with another issue. Once you have
agreed on a time with the person, you can describe the conflict, your feelings, and the impact
of the conflict and ask for a resolution.

# _41_


Anger Management _for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Clients_


For example, the interaction may sound like this:


_Joe:_ _Hey, Frank, sorry I’m late._


_Frank:_ _Hi, Joe. Can I talk to you about that?_


_Joe:_ _Sure. Is something wrong?_


_Frank:_ _Joe, I’ve noticed you’ve been late for the last few days when I’ve come to_

_pick you up. Today, I realized that I was starting to feel frustrated and a_

_bit taken for granted. When you are late, we are both late for the meeting,_

_which makes me uncomfortable. I like to be on time. I’m wondering if you_

_can make an effort to be on time in the future._


_Joe:_ _Frank, I didn’t realize how bothered you were about that. I apologize for_

_being late, and I will be on time in the future. I’m glad you brought this_

_problem up to me._


Of course, this is an idealized version of an outcome that may be achieved with the Conflict
Resolution Model. Joe could have responded unfavorably, or defensively, by accusing Frank of
making a big deal out of nothing. Joe may have minimized and discounted Frank’s feelings,
leaving the conflict unresolved.


The Conflict Resolution Model is useful even when conflicts are not resolved. Many times, you
will feel better about trying to resolve a conflict in an assertive manner rather than acting pas­
sively or aggressively. Specifically, you may feel that you have done all that you could do to
resolve the conflict. In this example, if Frank decided not to give Joe a ride in the future, or if
Frank decided to end his friendship with Joe, he could do so knowing that he first tried to
resolve the conflict in an assertive manner.

Have the group members practice using the Conflict Resolution Model by roleplaying. Be care­
ful not to push group members into a roleplay situation if they are not comfortable about it or
ready. Exercise your clinical judgment.


The following are some topics for roleplays:


- Dealing with a rude or unhelpful salesclerk


- Dealing with a physician who will not take the time to explain how a medication works


- Dealing with a supervisor who does not listen to you


- Dealing with a counselor who repeatedly cancels your therapy/counseling sessions


- Dealing with a friend who does not respect your privacy.

review the definitions of assertiveness, aggression, and passivity. Instruct them to practice
using the Conflict Resolution Model, preferably once a day during the coming week. Remind

##### **Anger and the Family** _How Past Learning Can_ _Influence Present Behavior_

Outline of Sessions 9 & 10


###### Sessions 9 & 10

Instructions to Group Leaders


As with sessions 7 and 8, sessions 9 and 10 are
combined because it takes more than one
session to answer the questions beginning on page
46 and connect the responses to current behavior.




- Instructions to Group Leaders


- Check-In Procedure


- Suggested Remarks


 - Anger and the Family


- Homework Assignment



Sessions 9 and 10 (comprising two 90-minute sessions) help group members gain a better
understanding of their anger with regard to the interactions they had with their parents and
the families that they grew up in (Reilly & Grusznski, 1984). Help them see how these past
interactions have influenced their current behavior, thoughts, feelings, and attitudes and the
way they now interact with others as adults.


Many people are unaware of the connection between past learning and current behavior.
Present a series of questions to the group members that will help them understand how their
learning histories relate to current patterns of behavior. Because of the nature and content of
this exercise, with its focus on family interactions, it is important that you monitor and structure
the exercise carefully, but at the same time provide a warm and supportive environment.
Experience has shown there is a tendency for group members to elaborate on many detailed
aspects of their family backgrounds that are beyond the scope of this exercise. Keep in mind
that family issues may bring up difficult and painful memories that could potentially trigger
anxiety, depression, or relapse to drug and alcohol use. It is important, therefore, to tell group
members that they are not required to answer any questions if they feel that they would be
emotionally overwhelmed by doing so. Instead, tell them that they can pursue these and other
issues with their individual or group therapist.


Check-In Procedure


Ask group members to report the highest level of anger they reached on the anger meter
during the past week. Make sure they reserve 10 for situations where they lost control of their
anger and experienced negative consequences. Ask them to describe the anger-provoking
event that led to their highest level of anger. Help them identify the cues that occurred in
response to the anger-provoking event, and help them classify these cues into the four cue
categories. Ask them to report on their use of the Conflict Resolution Model and the ongoing
development of their anger control plans.

_Anger and the Family_


In these sessions, you will explore how anger and other emotions were displayed by your par­
ents and in the families in which you grew up. For many of us, the interactions we have had
with our parents have strongly influenced our behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and attitudes as
adults. With regard to anger and its expression, these feelings and behaviors usually were
modeled for us by our parents or parental figures. The purpose of these sessions is to examine
the connection between what you have learned in the past, in the families in which you grew
up, and your current behavior and interactions with others now as adults. You will be asked a
series of questions concerning your parents and families. This is an involved and often emo­
tionally charged topic, so if you are not comfortable answering any questions, you do not have
to do so. Also, because there is a natural tendency to want to elaborate on family issues
because of their emotional content, please focus on answering the specific questions:


1. Describe your family. Did you live with both parents? Did you have any brothers and sisters?
Where did you grow up?


2. How was anger expressed in your family while you were growing up? How did your father
express anger? How did your mother express anger? (Possible probes to use: Did your par­
ents yell or throw things? Were you ever threatened with physical violence? Was your father
abusive to your mother or you?)


3. How were other emotions such as happiness and sadness expressed in your family? Were
warm emotions expressed frequently, or was emotional expression restricted to feelings of
anger and frustration? Were pleasant emotions expressed at birthdays or holidays?


4. How were you disciplined and by whom? Did this discipline involve being spanked or hit
with belts, switches, or paddles? (An assumption of the anger management treatment is
that no form of physical discipline is beneficial to a child. Empirical studies have shown that
nonphysical forms of discipline are very effective in shaping childhood behavior [Barkley,
1997; Ducharme, Atkinson, & Poulton, 2000; Webster-Stratton & Hammond, 1997]).


5. What role did you take in your family? For example, were you the hero, the rescuer, the vic­
tim, or the scapegoat?


6. What messages did you receive about your father and men in general? In other words, in
your experience, how were men supposed to act in society? What messages did you receive
about your mother and women in general? How were women supposed to act in society?
(Note: Many of the messages group members have received differ from messages that are
socially appropriate today. Point out the changing roles of men and women during the past
three decades.)

# _46_


_A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Manual_


7. What behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and attitudes carry over into your relationships as
adults today? What purpose do these behaviors serve? What would happen if you gave up
these behaviors? (The group leader should help group members see the connection
between past social learning and their current behavior.)


Homework Assignment


Have group members refer to the participant workbook. Ask them to monitor and record their
