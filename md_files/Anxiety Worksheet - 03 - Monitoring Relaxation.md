# Monitoring Your Relaxation Level

It is important to practice relaxation to achieve the best results, as this is a new skill that you are learning. You can monitor you own progress
by keeping a relaxation diary that records the when, where and how of your practice. This will help you to identify particular situations and / or
times of the day when you are most tense. Use the scale to indicate your level of relaxation before and after you complete your relaxation.
