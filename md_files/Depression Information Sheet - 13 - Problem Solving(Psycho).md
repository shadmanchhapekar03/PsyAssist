# Problem Solving

**1.     Identify and Define Problem Area/Issue**


  - try to state the problem as clearly as possible; be objective and specific; describe the problem
in terms of what you can observe rather than subjective feelings

  - try to identify what is maintaining the problem rather than just what caused it

  - set realistic and achievable goals for resolving the problem


**2.   Generate Potential Solutions**


  - list all possible solutions without evaluating their quality or feasibility

  - eliminate less desirable or unreasonable solutions only after as many possible solutions have
been listed

  - bearing in mind your goals for problem resolution, list the remaining solutions in order of
preference
