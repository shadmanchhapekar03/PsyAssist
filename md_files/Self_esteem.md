## **Emotional Well-Being and Self-Esteem Based on Relationship** **Status Among Adults**

### Ruchi Yadav [1] *


**ABSTRACT**
Romantic relationships are often considered a key source of emotional fulfillment, yet
research suggests that **well-being and self-esteem** depend on a variety of social and
psychological factors. This study examines the impact of relationship status on emotional
well-being and self-esteem among adults. A quantitative survey was conducted with 100
participants (50 singles, 50 in a relationship), utilizing the **Warwick-Edinburgh Mental**
**Well-Being Scale** (WEMWBS) and the **Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale** (RSES) to measure
emotional well-being and self-esteem, respectively. The results indicate that emotional wellbeing scores did not significantly differ between singles and those in relationships **(p =**
**0.128).** However, self-esteem was significantly higher among singles compared to those in
relationships **(p = 0.003)** . These findings suggest that while relationships may provide
emotional support, self-esteem is influenced by personal and societal factors beyond
relationship status. This research challenges assumptions that romantic involvement
inherently enhances psychological well-being and highlights the need to consider relationship
quality rather than mere status.

motional well-being and self-esteem are fundamental components of mental health,
influencing an individual’s quality of life, decision-making, and interpersonal
relationships. Emotional well-being refers to a person’s ability to manage emotions,
# E
experience happiness, and maintain a sense of life satisfaction, while self-esteem pertains to
an individual’s perception of their own worth and competence.

One factor often believed to shape well-being and self-esteem is relationship status.
Romantic relationships are frequently associated with emotional fulfillment, companionship,
and social validation. Many societal narratives emphasize that being in a relationship leads
to greater happiness, while being single is often seen as undesirable or lonely. However,
contemporary psychological research suggests that the impact of relationship status on wellbeing and self-esteem is complex and may depend on individual personality, social support,
and relationship quality rather than the mere presence or absence of a partner.

**Emotional Well-Being and Self-Esteem Based on Relationship Status Among Adults**


Some studies indicate that individuals in committed relationships experience higher levels of
happiness and life satisfaction, attributing this to the emotional support and companionship
provided by their partners (Myers, 2000). However, other research suggests that single
individuals who have strong social networks, fulfilling careers, and personal autonomy can
experience equally high, if not higher, levels of well-being and self-esteem (DePaulo &
Morris, 2005). Moreover, toxic or unsatisfying relationships have been found to negatively
impact self-esteem and emotional health (Knee et al., 2005).
Given these contrasting perspectives, it is essential to explore the real impact of relationship
status on emotional well-being and self-esteem using empirical data. This study aims to
determine whether singles and individuals in relationships differ significantly in their
psychological well-being and to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how
relationships influence mental health.

1. Challenges Stereotypes About Singlehood

- In many cultures, single individuals are often perceived as lonely, unfulfilled, or struggling
with self-worth. This study challenges such notions by investigating whether singles actually
experience lower self-esteem and emotional well-being compared to those in relationships.

2. Examines the Role of Relationship Quality vs. Status

- Being in a healthy and supportive relationship can boost well-being, but being in a toxic or
unsatisfying relationship can negatively affect self-esteem. Simply categorizing people as
“single” or “in a relationship” may overlook the quality of those relationships.

3. Contributes to Psychological and Mental Health Research

- Findings from this study can help mental health professionals understand how relationship
status influences self-esteem and well-being, aiding in the development of counseling
strategies for individuals struggling with relationship-related self-perceptions.

4. Encourages Personal Fulfillment Beyond Romantic Relationships

- By analyzing self-esteem and well-being across relationship statuses, this research
highlights the importance of personal growth, friendships, and self-acceptance as key
determinants of mental health.

_**Research Questions**_
This study seeks to answer the following questions:

1. Do individuals in relationships report higher levels of emotional well-being

compared to singles?
2. Is there a significant difference in self-esteem between singles and those in

relationships?
3. Does relationship status alone determine psychological well-being, or are other

factors more influential?

This study provides an empirical analysis of these questions by using statistically validated
self-report measures to compare emotional well-being and self-esteem between singles and
individuals in relationships.

_**Rationale**_
The question of whether being in a relationship significantly enhances emotional well-being
and self-esteem remains unresolved. While societal expectations often pressure individuals
to pursue romantic relationships as a source of fulfillment, psychological research suggests

**Emotional Well-Being and Self-Esteem Based on Relationship Status Among Adults**


that personal happiness and self-worth are influenced by multiple factors, including social
networks, career satisfaction, and self-acceptance.

**REVIEW OF LITERATURE**
Understanding the impact of relationship status on emotional well-being and self-esteem has
been a topic of psychological research for decades. While older studies laid the foundation
for theories on social relationships and mental health, recent studies provide more nuanced
insights, incorporating factors like relationship quality, autonomy, and societal changes.
This section presents a chronological review of relevant studies, starting with the most
recent research.

**1. Emotional Well-Being and Relationship Status**
Emotional well-being is defined as an individual’s ability to experience positive emotions,
manage stress, and maintain overall life satisfaction. While earlier research suggested that
being in a relationship enhances well-being, newer studies highlight the role of relationship
quality and personal fulfillment beyond romantic partnerships. **Adamczyk (2017)** found that
single individuals with strong friendships and social networks report life satisfaction levels
comparable to those in relationships. The study challenges outdated notions that singlehood
is linked to loneliness and lower well-being. **Soons & Liefbroer (2008)** emphasized that
relationship quality matters more than status. Their study revealed that individuals in
unhappy relationships had lower emotional well-being than satisfied singles. **Simon &**
**Barrett (2010)** explored gender differences and found that single women, in particular,
experience higher autonomy and self-growth, which contribute positively to emotional wellbeing. **Kamp Dush & Amato (2005)** raised concerns about causality, arguing that while
happier individuals are more likely to enter relationships, being in a relationship does not
necessarily cause greater happiness. **Myers (2000)** presented early findings suggesting that
married individuals report higher life satisfaction due to companionship and emotional
support, though later studies questioned whether this applies universally.

**2. Self-Esteem and Romantic Relationships**
Self-esteem reflects an individual’s self-worth, confidence, and perception of personal value.
While relationships can provide validation, they may also contribute to dependency and
lower self-esteem if they are unstable or controlling.

**Budgeon (2016** ) explored societal shifts in singlehood, noting that modern single
individuals focus more on career, personal growth, and independence, contributing to high
self-esteem. **Erol & Orth (2011)** conducted a longitudinal study and found that while
relationships can contribute to self-esteem, the effects were small and influenced more by
personality traits than relationship status. **Leary & Baumeister (2000** ) introduced the
Sociometer Theory, proposing that self-esteem is an internal measure of social acceptance—
while relationships can boost self-esteem, they are not the sole factor. **Murray et al. (2000)**
discovered that individuals with low self-esteem often seek validation from relationships,
making them vulnerable to relationship dependency and dissatisfaction. **Robins et al. (2002)**
concluded that self-esteem is relatively stable over time and is not significantly altered by
relationship status, suggesting that personal development plays a greater role. Recent studies
emphasize that self-esteem is shaped more by personal growth and independence rather than
relationship status alone.

**3. The Role of Relationship Quality**
More than relationship status, relationship quality is a crucial factor in determining
emotional well-being and self-esteem. A high-quality, supportive relationship can enhance
mental health, while an unhealthy one can lead to emotional distress. Girme et al. (2018)
examined how attachment styles affect well-being, showing that securely attached
individuals benefit more from relationships than those with anxious or avoidant attachment
styles. Finkel et al. (2014) suggested that high-quality relationships provide emotional
security and resilience, contributing to greater psychological well-being. Knee et al. (2005)
found that individuals in unhealthy relationships experience lower self-esteem and greater
emotional distress than those who are single. Rusbult et al. (2001) introduced the Investment
Model, which posits that relationship satisfaction, commitment, and quality of alternatives
determine whether a relationship enhances well-being. Recent research suggests that
relationship quality—not just relationship status—has a greater impact on emotional wellbeing and self-esteem.

**4. Gender Differences in the Impact of Relationship Status**
Men and women often experience different psychological effects of relationship status,
influenced by societal expectations and emotional coping mechanisms. Bianchi et al. (2000)
found that single women report higher life satisfaction than single men, likely due to
stronger social networks and greater independence. Simon & Nath (2004) discovered that
unmarried women tend to experience higher psychological well-being compared to
unmarried men, possibly due to greater emotional self-sufficiency. Helgeson (1994)
suggested that women in relationships may experience higher stress levels due to caregiving
responsibilities and emotional labor, making singlehood more psychologically beneficial for
some women. Umberson et al. (1996) found that men benefit emotionally from marriage
more than women, as they tend to rely on their spouses for emotional support, whereas
women maintain broader social networks. Recent studies show that relationship status
affects men and women differently, with single women often reporting higher well-being
than single men, likely due to social and cultural factors.

Emotional well-being is influenced more by relationship quality, social support, and
personal fulfillment rather than just relationship status. Self-esteem is not significantly
determined by being in a relationship, with recent research emphasizing personal
independence and self-growth. Relationship quality plays a greater role in well-being and
self-esteem than simply being single or in a relationship. Gender differences exist, with men
often benefiting more from relationships while women find greater autonomy and wellbeing in singlehood.

**METHODOLOGY**
_**Aim**_
The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether there are significant differences in
emotional well-being and self-esteem between individuals who are single and those who are
in a relationship.

_**Research Design**_
This study employs a quantitative, cross-sectional survey design to examine the relationship
between emotional well-being and self-esteem based on relationship status. A survey-based
approach was chosen as it allows for efficient data collection from a diverse sample within a
limited timeframe.

**Emotional Well-Being and Self-Esteem Based on Relationship Status Among Adults**


_**Hypothesis**_

  - **H1:** There is significant difference in emotional well-being between individuals who

are single and those who are in a relationship.

  - **H2:** There is a significant difference in self-esteem between individuals who are

single and those who are in a relationship.

_**Variables**_

  - Independent Variable: Relationship status (Single or In a Relationship)

  - Dependent Variables: Emotional well-being and self-esteem scores

_**Sample**_

  - A total of 100 participants were selected using convenience sampling from social

media platforms, university networks, and community groups.

  - Participant Characteristics

  - Sample Size: 100 individuals (50 singles 50 individuals in a relationship)

  - Age Range: 25–40 years

_**Inclusion Criteria**_

  - Adults aged 25-40 years

  - Must identify as single or in a romantic relationship

_**Exclusion Criteria**_

  - Individuals in casual or undefined relationships

  - Individuals undergoing therapy for severe mental health issues

_**Tools**_
To assess emotional well-being and self-esteem, two standardized self-report measures were
used:

**1.** **Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS):** Emotional Well
Being the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) is a 14-item
scale designed to measure positive mental well-being. Responses are scored on a 5point Likert scale ranging from 1 (None of the time) to 5 (All of the time), with
higher scores indicating greater emotional well-being.
**2.** **Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) – Self-Esteem:** The Rosenberg Self-Esteem

Scale (RSES) is a 10-item scale used to measure self-worth and self-respect.
Responses are recorded on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree)
to 4 (Strongly Agree). Example Question: “I feel that I have a number of good
qualities.” Scores range from 10 to 40, with higher scores indicating higher selfesteem.

_**Procedure**_
Survey Distribution: An online survey was created using Google Forms and distributed via
social media, university networks, and email invitations. Participants were informed about
the purpose of the study, and voluntary consent was obtained before participation.
Participants first answered demographic questions (age, gender, relationship status). They
then completed the WEMWBS and RSES scales. Time Commitment: The survey took
approximately 10-15 minutes per participant. Anonymity & Confidentiality: Responses were
anonymous, and no personal identifiers were collected. Data was stored securely and used
exclusively for research purposes.

_**Statistical Analysis**_
**1. Descriptive Statistics**
Mean and Standard Deviation were calculated for emotional well-being and self-esteem
scores for both groups (Singles and In a Relationship).

**2. Inferential Statistics**

  - Independent Samples t-test: Used to compare the mean scores of singles vs.

individuals in relationships for emotional well-being and self-esteem.

  - Welch’s t-test was applied due to possible differences in variance between groups.

  - Statistical Significance Threshold: p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The F-value (9.05) is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.003 (< 0.05). This confirms
that self-esteem significantly differs between singles and those in relationships.

**DISCUSSION**
This study aimed to examine the impact of relationship status on emotional well-being and
self-esteem among adults. Using standardized psychological measures, we compared scores
between singles and individuals in relationships. The results provide important insights into
how relationship status influences mental health and self-worth.

**Emotional Well-Being and Self-Esteem Based on Relationship Status Among Adults**


Emotional Well-Being and Relationship Status: The results revealed that individuals in
relationships reported slightly higher emotional well-being (M = 165.68, SD = 25.97) than
singles (M = 157.46, SD = 27.49). However, this difference was not statistically significant
(p = 0.128), suggesting that being in a romantic relationship does not inherently enhance
emotional well-being. These findings align with prior research by Soons & Liefbroer (2008),
who found that relationship quality is more important than relationship status in determining
well-being. Similarly, Adamczyk (2017) reported that singles with strong social support
systems experience comparable life satisfaction to those in relationships. The current study
reinforces the idea that personal fulfillment, social networks, and life satisfaction are not
dependent on having a romantic partner. Additionally, the null effect on emotional wellbeing challenges traditional societal beliefs that romantic relationships are necessary for
happiness. This aligns with modern perspectives that emphasize personal independence,
career fulfillment, and strong friendships as alternative sources of well-being.

Self-Esteem and Relationship Status: Unlike emotional well-being, self-esteem showed a
significant difference between singles and those in relationships. Singles reported higher
self-esteem (M = 23.58, SD = 2.83) compared to those in relationships (M = 21.92, SD =
2.69), and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.003). These findings are
consistent with Budgeon (2016), who argued that modern singlehood is increasingly
associated with personal independence and self-growth. Similarly, DePaulo & Morris (2005)
challenged the stereotype that single individuals suffer from lower self-esteem or social
inadequacy, instead emphasizing that self-reliance and autonomy contribute positively to
self-worth. One possible explanation for the higher self-esteem in singles is that individuals
in relationships may experience greater social comparison, emotional dependence, or
relationship-related insecurities, leading to a slight decrease in self-esteem. Research by
Murray et al. (2000) found that individuals with lower self-esteem are more likely to seek
validation in relationships, which can sometimes create emotional dependency and
dissatisfaction. Moreover, gender differences may also play a role. Studies suggest that
women often experience higher emotional labor and caregiving responsibilities in
relationships (Helgeson, 1994), which may contribute to stress and self-esteem fluctuations.
The findings highlight the importance of personal fulfillment beyond romantic relationships.
Since emotional well-being was not significantly impacted by relationship status, mental
health professionals should encourage individuals to develop self-acceptance, strong social
connections, and personal goals, rather than relying solely on romantic relationships for
emotional fulfillment. For individuals struggling with relationship-related self-esteem issues,
counseling interventions can focus on self-worth beyond external validation. Therapeutic
approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help individuals develop intrinsic
self-esteem rather than seeking reassurance from romantic partners.

These results challenge the social stigma surrounding singlehood. Many cultures emphasize
that being in a relationship is essential for happiness, but the data suggests otherwise.
Societal narratives should shift towards normalizing singlehood as a fulfilling and
independent life choice.

Since relationship quality plays a greater role in well-being than simply being in a
relationship, future research should focus on how relationship dynamics (e.g.,
communication, conflict resolution, support systems) influence mental health rather than just
categorizing individuals as “single” or “in a relationship.”

**Emotional Well-Being and Self-Esteem Based on Relationship Status Among Adults**


**CONCLUSION**
This study explored the relationship between relationship status, emotional well-being, and
self-esteem among adults. The results indicate that emotional well-being does not
significantly differ between singles and those in relationships, suggesting that romantic
involvement is not a prerequisite for happiness. However, the findings revealed that selfesteem is significantly higher among singles, challenging societal narratives that equate
romantic relationships with greater self-worth. These findings align with modern
psychological research emphasizing personal independence, social networks, and selfacceptance as key contributors to well-being. Additionally, the study underscores the
importance of relationship quality over mere relationship status, as previous research has
shown that individuals in unhealthy relationships may experience lower well-being than
satisfied singles. The implications of these results suggest that mental health professionals
should promote self-worth beyond romantic validation and encourage individuals to pursue
personal fulfillment in various life domains. While the study provides valuable insights,
limitations such as sample size, self-report measures, and the lack of relationship quality
assessment should be addressed in future research. Future studies should incorporate
longitudinal designs, diverse samples, and in-depth analyses of relationship satisfaction to
further explore the complexities of emotional well-being and self-esteem. Ultimately, this
research challenges traditional beliefs surrounding relationships and reinforces the idea that
individuals can thrive both within and outside of romantic partnerships.
