An Introduction to _The World of Psychology_


As we just learned, **psychology** is formally defined as the scientific study of behavior
and mental processes. But what makes psychology a science? Many people believe
that a field is a science because of the nature of its body of knowledge. Few people
question whether physics, for example, is a true science. But a science isn’t a science
because of its subject matter. A field of study qualifies as a science if it uses the _scientific_
_method_ to acquire knowledge.



The Scientific Method







The **scientific method** consists of the orderly, systematic procedures that researchers
follow as they identify a research problem, design a study to investigate the problem,
collect and analyze data, draw conclusions, and communicate their findings. The
scientific method is the most objective method known for acquiring knowledge
(Christensen, 2007). The knowledge gained is dependable because of the method used
to obtain it.

Decades of research on learning and memory have
uncovered a number of strategies that you can use,
in addition to the SQ3R method, to make your study
time more efficient and effective.


- Establish a quiet place, free of distractions, where
you do nothing else but study. You can condition
yourself to associate this environment with studying, so that entering the room or area will be your
cue to begin work.

- Schedule your study time. Research on memory
has proven that spaced learning is more effective
than massed practice (cramming). Instead of
studying for 5 hours straight, try five study sessions of 1 hour each.

- To be prepared for each class meeting, set specific
goals for yourself each week and for individual
study sessions. Your goals should be challenging
but not overwhelming. If the task for an individual
study session is manageable, it will be easier to sit
down and face it. Completing the task you have
set for yourself will give you a sense of accomplishment.

- The more active a role you play in the learning
process, the more you will remember. Spend some
of your study time reciting rather than rereading the
material. One effective method is to use index cards



BEST PRACTICES FOR EFFECTIVE STUDYING



as flash cards. Write a key term or study question on
the front of each card. On the back, list pertinent information from the text and class lectures. Use these
cards to help you prepare for tests.

- _Overlearning_ means studying beyond the point at
which you can just barely recite the information you
are trying to memorize. Review the information again
and again until it is firmly locked in memory. If you
are subject to test anxiety, overlearning will help.

- Forgetting takes place most rapidly within the first
24 hours after you study. No matter how much you
have studied for a test, always review shortly before you take it. Refreshing your memory will raise
your grade.

- Sleeping immediately after you study will help you
retain more of what you have learned. If you can’t
study before you go to sleep, at least review what
you studied earlier in the day. This is also a good
time to go through your index cards.


Once you’ve mastered these study strategies, use
them to improve your comprehension and success in
all your courses.

FIGURE 1.1 The Scientific Method


These are the steps involved in the scientific method.



**theory** A general principle or set of
principles proposed to explain how a
number of separate facts are related.


**hypothesis** A prediction about a
relationship between two or more
variables.



The scientific method includes the following steps (see FIGURE 1.1):


OBSERVE AND THEORIZE. The first step in the scientific method is an interactive
one in which a researcher observes some phenomenon and _theorizes_, or develops a
hunch, about what might have led to it. For instance, suppose a psychologist observes students playing video games on a big-screen TV in a student lounge and notices that the men tend to get higher scores than the women do. She might speculate
that this gender difference results from differences in the amount of time that men
and women spend playing video games. In other words, her hunch is that, in general, men get higher scores on video games because they practice more than women
do. Such hunches are often derived from a psychological **theory**, a general principle
or set of principles proposed to explain how a number of separate facts are related.
In our example, the researcher’s hunch seems to be based on a theory that emphasizes the role of experience in shaping behavior; that is, her theory proposes that the
more experience people have doing something, the better they are at doing it.


FORMULATE A HYPOTHESIS. Based on her hunch about the cause of gender differences in video game scores, the researcher next comes up with a **hypothesis**, a prediction that can be tested _empirically_ —that is, with data. Although the researcher’s theory
suggests many possible hypotheses, one, in particular, is key to understanding the
contribution of practice to video game scores: _If males and females spend equal amounts of_
_time practicing a game, their scores will be equal_ .


DESIGN A STUDY. Next, to test the hypothesis about equal practice, the researcher
designs a study in which she uses the same procedures to teach male and female students how to play a new video game. Then she allows them 30 minutes to practice it
on their own. At the end of the practice session, she tells participants to play the game
one more time and to try for the highest score possible.


COLLECT DATA. Once the researcher conducts her study, she collects the data that
could be relevant to her hypothesis. First, she calculates an average score for male and
female participants. Then she calculates the amount of time that participants actually
spent practicing the game. This information could be critical in interpreting the
study’s results, because, even though each participant is allowed 30 minutes to practice, the researcher cannot assume that they will all practice an equal amount of time.


APPLY RESULTS TO THE HYPOTHESIS. If the researcher finds that the video game
scores for males and females are equivalent, she can conclude that the data support her
hypothesis; given the same amount of practice time, males and females will score


equally well. However, she cannot stop there. The researcher must repeat the study
using the same procedures to determine whether her findings are a one-time phenomenon or if they are the result of a true, underlying psychological principle. This process
is called **replication** .
On the other hand, if the researcher finds that males still get higher scores than females, she must concede that the results do not support her hypothesis and she must
modify it. However, this is where the researcher’s data on actual practice time may
come in handy: If the data show that males spent more time engaged in actual practice
than females did, the researcher can assert that the study’s outcome supports her hypothesis after all. Still, she must modify her hypothesis to include a testable assertion
about why the men in her study chose to practice more than the women did. If she hypothesizes that the practice difference was caused by the type of game used in the
study, for example, in a subsequent study she would go on to examine how different
types of games affect practice time.



The Goals of Psychology







What goals do psychological researchers pursue when they plan and conduct their
studies? Briefly put, the goals of psychology are to describe, explain, predict, and influence behavior and mental processes. Let’s look at each goal in a bit more detail.
_Description_ is usually the first step in understanding any behavior or mental
process and is therefore important in a very new area of research or in the early stages
of research. To attain this goal, researchers describe the behavior or mental process of
interest as accurately and completely as possible. A description tells _what_ occurred.
The second goal, _explanation_, requires an understanding of the conditions under
which a given behavior or mental process occurs. Such an understanding often enables researchers to state the causes of the behavior or mental process they are studying. But researchers do not reach the goal of explanation until their results have been
tested, retested, and confirmed. The way researchers confirm an explanation is by
eliminating or ruling out other explanations. An explanation tells _why_ a given event or
behavior occurred.
The goal of _prediction_ is met when researchers can specify the conditions under
which a behavior or event is likely to occur. Once researchers can identify all the antecedent (prior) conditions required for a behavior or event to occur, they can predict
that behavior or event.
The goal of _influence_ is accomplished when researchers know how to apply a principle or change a condition in order to prevent unwanted occurrences or bring about
desired outcomes.
_Review It_ summarizes the goals of psychology and applies them to the video game
hypothesis discussed earlier.

Two types of research help psychologists accomplish the four goals just described:
basic research and applied research. The purpose of **basic research** is to seek new
knowledge and to explore and advance general scientific understanding. Basic research explores such topics as the nature of memory, brain function, motivation, and
emotional expression. **Applied research** is conducted specifically for the purpose of
solving practical problems and improving the quality of life. Applied research focuses
on finding methods to improve memory or increase motivation, therapies to treat psychological disorders, ways to decrease stress, and so on. This type of research is primarily concerned with the fourth goal of psychology—influence—because it specifies
ways and means of changing behavior.
These types of research have enabled psychologists to accumulate a vast knowledge base about behavior and mental processes. However, information alone doesn’t
necessarily advance our understanding of psychological phenomena. As we noted
earlier, using knowledge acquired through the scientific method to develop theories
can help us in the quest for understanding. With that in mind, we’ll turn our attention
to some early attempts at psychological theory-building and the schools of thought
that arose from debates between the early theorists and their critics.

Exploring Psychology’s Roots



If you were to trace the development of psychology from the beginning, you would
need to start before the earliest pages of recorded history, beyond even the early Greek
philosophers, such as Aristotle and Plato. However, it was not until experimental
methods were applied to the study of psychological processes that psychology became
recognized as a formal academic discipline. **Explore** on **MyPsychLab**


Structuralism


Who were the “founders” of psychology? Historians acknowledge that three German
scientists—Ernst Weber, Gustav Fechner, and Hermann von Helmholtz—were the first
to systematically study behavior and mental processes. But it is Wilhelm Wundt
(1832–1920) who is generally thought of as the “father” of psychology. Wundt’s vision
for the new discipline included studies of social and cultural influences on human
thought (Benjafield, 1996).
Wundt established a psychological laboratory at the University of Leipzig in Germany in 1879, an event considered to mark the birth of psychology as a formal academic discipline. Using a method called _introspection_, Wundt and his associates studied
the perception of a variety of visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli, including the rhythm
patterns produced by metronomes set at different speeds. Introspection as a research
method involves looking inward to examine one’s own conscious experience and then
reporting that experience.
Wundt’s most famous student, Englishman Edward Bradford Titchener
(1867–1927), took the new field to the United States, where he set up a psychological


Introduction to Psychology 7



laboratory at Cornell University. He gave the name
**structuralism** to this first formal school of thought in psychology, which endeavored to analyze the basic elements,
or the structure, of conscious mental experience. Like
Wundt before him, Titchener thought that consciousness
could be reduced to its basic elements, just as water (H _2_ O)
can be broken down into its constituent elements—hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O). For Wundt, pure sensations—
such as sweetness, coldness, or redness—were the basic
elements of consciousness. And these pure sensations, he
believed, combined to form perceptions.
The work of both Wundt and Titchener was criticized
for its primary method, introspection. Introspection is not
objective, even though it involves observation, measurement, and experimentation. When different introspectionists were exposed to the same stimulus, such as the click of
a metronome, they frequently reported different experi
                    
ences. Therefore, structuralism was not in favor for long.
Later schools of thought in psychology were established,
partly as a reaction against structuralism, which did not
survive after the death of its most ardent spokesperson,
Titchener. Nevertheless, the structuralists were responsible for establishing psychology as a science through their insistence that psychological
processes could be measured and studied using methods similar to those employed by
scientists in other fields.




- Even though these skydivers share the same sensations—the
feeling of falling, the rush of air on their faces as they fall, and the
sudden lurch of their parachutes opening—their reported
introspections of the experience would probably differ.



Functionalism







As structuralism was losing its influence in the United States in the early 20th century,
a new school of psychology called functionalism was taking shape. **Functionalism**
was concerned not with the structure of consciousness, but with how mental processes function—that is, how humans and animals use mental processes in adapting to
their environment. The influential work of Charles Darwin (1809–1882), especially his
ideas about evolution and the continuity of species, was largely responsible for an increasing use of animals in psychological experiments. Even though Darwin, who was
British, contributed important seeds of thought that helped give birth to the new
school of psychology, functionalism was primarily American in character and spirit.
The famous American psychologist William James (1842–1910) was an advocate of
functionalism, even though he did much of his writing before this school of psychology emerged. James’s best-known work is his highly regarded and frequently quoted
textbook _Principles of Psychology_, published more than a century ago (1890). James
taught that mental processes are fluid and have continuity rather than the rigid, or
fixed, structure that the structuralists suggested. James spoke of the “stream of consciousness,” which, he said, functions to help humans adapt to their environment.
How did functionalism change psychology? Functionalism broadened the scope
of psychology to include the study of behavior as well as mental processes. It also allowed the study of children, animals, and individuals with mental impairments,
groups that could not be studied by the structuralists because they could not be
trained to use introspection. Functionalism also focused on an applied, more practical
use of psychology by encouraging the study of educational practices, individual differences, and adaptation in the workplace (industrial psychology).

- **1.5** In what ways have
women and minorities
shaped the field of psychology, both in the past
and today?



From its beginning until the mid–20th century, the field of psychology was shaped and
dominated largely by White European and American males. For centuries, conventional thought had held that higher education was exclusively for White males, that
women should rear children and be homemakers, and that minorities were best suited
for manual labor. And, as Thomas Paine observed in his influential pamphlet _Common_

to the desegregation of public schools
in the United States.



_Sense_ (1776), “A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right.” However, beginning in the late 19th century, women and minorities overcame these prejudices to make notable achievements in and contributions to
the study of psychology.


PIONEERING WOMEN. Christine Ladd-Franklin (1847–1930) completed the requirements for a Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University in the mid-1880s but had to wait over
40 years before receiving her degree in 1926, when the university finally agreed to
grant women doctoral degrees. Ladd-Franklin formulated a well-regarded, evolutionary theory of color vision.
In 1895, Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) completed the requirements for a doctorate at Harvard. And even though William James described her as one of his most capable students, Harvard refused to grant the degree to a woman (Dewsbury, 2000).
Undeterred, Calkins established a psychology laboratory at Wellesley College and developed the paired-associates test, an important research technique for the study of
memory. She became the first female president of the American Psychological Association in 1905.
Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) received her Ph.D. in psychology from Cornell University and later taught at Vassar College (Dewsbury, 2000). She wrote several
books, among them _The Animal Mind_ (1908), an influential book on animal behavior,
and _Movement and Mental Imagery_ (1916).


AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHER GROUPS. Francis Cecil Sumner (1895–1954)
was a self-taught scholar. In 1920, without benefit of a formal high school education,
he became the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in psychology, from Clark University. This feat was accomplished “in spite of innumerable social and physical factors mitigating against such achievements by black people in America” (Guthrie, 1998,
p. 177). Sumner translated more than 3,000 articles from German, French, and Spanish.
He chaired the psychology department at Howard University and is known as the “father” of African American psychology.
Albert Sidney Beckham (1897–1964), another African American psychologist,
conducted some impressive early studies on intelligence and showed how it is related to success in numerous occupational fields. Beckham also established the first
psychological laboratory at an African American institution of higher learning—
Howard University.
More recently, African American psychologist Kenneth Clark (1914–2005) achieved
national recognition for his writings on the harmful effects of racial segregation. His
work affected the Supreme Court ruling that declared racial segregation in U.S. schools
to be unconstitutional (Benjamin & Crouse, 2002). His wife, Mamie Phipps Clark
(1917–1983), also achieved recognition when the couple published their works on racial
identification and self-esteem, which are regarded as classics in the field (Lal, 2002).
Hispanic American George Sánchez (1906–1972) conducted studies on bias in intelligence testing during the 1930s (Sánchez, 1932, 1934). He pointed out that both cultural differences and language differences work against Hispanic students when they
take IQ tests.
Native American and Asian American psychologists have made important contributions to psychological research as well. Moreover, they are the fastest growing minority groups in the field of psychology. The percentage of doctorates awarded to
individuals in both groups more than doubled from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s
(National Science Foundation, 2000). One contemporary Native American psychologist, Marigold Linton, is known for her research examining autobiographical memory.
In 1999, Richard Suinn, an eminent researcher in behavioral psychology, became the
first Asian American president of the American Psychological Association (APA).
Today, more women than men obtain degrees in psychology, and minority group
representation is growing (NCES, 2006, 2008). However, there continues to be a gap
between the proportion of minorities in the U.S. population and their representation
among professional psychologists (APA, 2000). Consequently, the APA and other organizations have established programs to encourage minority enrollment in graduate
programs in psychology.

**behaviorism** The school of psychology founded by John B. Watson
that views observable, measurable
behavior as the appropriate subject
matter for psychology and emphasizes the key role of environment
as a determinant of behavior.



Schools of Thought in Psychology


Why don’t we hear about structuralism and functionalism today? In the early 20th
century, the debate between the two points of view sparked a veritable explosion of
theoretical discussion and research examining psychological processes. The result was
the appearance of new theories that were better able to explain behavior and mental
processes. The foundations of the major schools of thought in the field were established during that period and continue to be influential today.



Behaviorism



**1.6** How do behaviorists

- explain behavior and
mental processes?



Psychologist John B. Watson (1878–1958) looked at the study of psychology as defined
by the structuralists and functionalists and disliked virtually everything he saw. In his
article “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It” (1913), Watson proposed a radically new
approach to psychology, one that rejected the subjectivity of both structuralism and
functionalism. This new school redefined psychology as the “science of behavior.”
Termed **behaviorism** by Watson, this school of psychology confines itself to the study of
behavior because behavior is observable and measurable and, therefore, objective and scientific. Behaviorism also emphasizes that behavior is determined primarily by factors in the environment.
Behaviorism was the most influential school of thought in
American psychology until the 1960s. It is still a major force in
modern psychology, in large part because of the profound influence of B. F. Skinner (1904–1990). Skinner agreed with Watson
that concepts such as mind, consciousness, and feelings are neither objective nor measurable and, therefore, not appropriate
subject matter for psychology. Furthermore, Skinner argued that
these concepts are not needed in order to explain behavior. One
can explain behavior, he claimed, by analyzing the conditions
that are present before a behavior occurs and then analyzing the
consequences that follow the behavior.
Skinner’s research on _operant conditioning_ emphasized the
importance of reinforcement in learning as well as in shaping
and maintaining behavior. He maintained that any behavior that
is reinforced (followed by pleasant or rewarding consequences) is more likely to be performed again. Skinner’s work has had a
powerful influence on modern psychology. You will read more
about operant conditioning in Chapter 5.




- Behaviorist B. F. Skinner claimed that any behavior is best
understood by analyzing the conditions that are present
before it occurs and by analyzing the consequences that
follow the behavior. How would you apply this concept to the
behavior of using an umbrella?

**1.9** What is the focus
of cognitive psychology?


**cognitive psychology** The school
of psychology that views humans as
active participants in their environment; studies mental processes such
as memory, problem solving, reasoning, decision making, perception, language, and other forms of cognition.



Psychoanalysis


Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), whose life and work you will study in Chapter 13, developed a theory of human behavior based largely on case studies of his patients. Freud’s
theory, **psychoanalysis**, maintains that human mental life is like an iceberg. The smallest, visible part of the iceberg represents the conscious mental experience of the individual. But underwater, hidden from view, floats a vast store of unconscious impulses,
wishes, and desires. Freud insisted that individuals do not consciously control their
thoughts, feelings, and behavior; these are instead determined by unconscious forces.
Freud believed that the unconscious is the storehouse for material that threatens
the conscious life of the individual—disturbing sexual and aggressive impulses as
well as traumatic experiences that have been repressed, or pushed down, to the unconscious. Once there, rather than resting quietly (out of sight, out of mind), the unconscious material festers and seethes.
The overriding importance that Freud placed on sexual and aggressive impulses
caused much controversy both inside and outside the field of psychology. The most
notable of Freud’s famous students—Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Karen Horney—
broke away from their mentor and developed their own theories of personality. These
three and their followers are often collectively referred to as _neo-Freudians_ .
The general public has heard of such concepts as the unconscious, repression, rationalization, and the Freudian slip. Such familiarity has made Sigmund Freud a largerthan-life figure rather than an obscure Austrian doctor resting within the dusty pages
of history. Although Freud continues to influence popular culture, the volume of research on psychoanalysis has continued to diminish steadily (Robins et al., 1999). Still,
the psychoanalytic approach continues to be influential, although in a form that has
been modified considerably over the past several decades by the neo-Freudians.


Humanistic Psychology


Humanistic psychologists reject with equal vigor (1) the behaviorist view that behavior is determined by factors in the environment and (2) the pessimistic view of the psychoanalytic approach, that human behavior is determined primarily by unconscious
forces. **Humanistic psychology** focuses on the uniqueness of human beings and their
capacity for choice, growth, and psychological health.
Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) and other early humanists, such as Carl Rogers
(1902–1987), pointed out that Freud based his theory primarily on data from his disturbed patients. By contrast, the humanists emphasize a much more positive view of
human nature. They maintain that people are innately good and that they possess free
will. The humanists believe that people are capable of making conscious, rational
choices, which can lead to personal growth and psychological health.
As you will learn in Chapter 13, Maslow proposed a theory of motivation that
consists of a hierarchy of needs. He considered the need for _self-actualization_ (developing to one’s fullest potential) to be the highest need on the hierarchy. Carl Rogers developed what he called _person-centered therapy,_ an approach in which the client, or
patient, directs a discussion focused on his or her own view of a problem rather than
on the therapist’s analysis. Rogers and other humanists also popularized group therapy as part of the human potential movement. Thus, the humanistic perspective continues to be important in research examining human motivation and in the practice of
psychotherapy.


Cognitive Psychology


Cognitive psychology grew and developed partly in response to strict behaviorism,
especially in the United States (Robins et al., 1999). **Cognitive psychology** views humans not as passive recipients who are pushed and pulled by environmental forces,
but as active participants who seek out experiences, who alter and shape those experiences, and who use mental processes to transform information in the course of their
own cognitive development. It studies mental processes such as memory, problem
solving, reasoning, decision making, perception, language, and other forms of cognition. Historically, modern cognitive psychology is derived from two streams of


Introduction to Psychology 11



thought: one that began with a small group of German scientists studying human perception in the early 20th century and another that grew up alongside the emerging field
of computer science in the second half of the century.



GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY. **Gestalt psychology** made its
appearance in Germany in 1912. The Gestalt psychologists, notably Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler, emphasized that individuals perceive objects
and patterns as whole units and that the perceived whole
is more than the sum of its parts. The German word _Gestalt_
roughly means “whole, form, or pattern.”
To support the Gestalt theory, Wertheimer, the leader
of the Gestalt psychologists, performed his famous experiment demonstrating the _phi phenomenon_ . In this experiment, two light bulbs are placed a short distance apart in a dark room. The first light is flashed on and then turned off
just as the second light is flashed on. As this pattern of
flashing the lights on and off continues, an observer sees having a bad day.”
what appears to be a single light moving back and forth
from one position to another. Here, said the Gestaltists, is
proof that people perceive wholes or patterns rather than
collections of separate sensations.
When the Nazis came to power in Germany in the 1930s, the Gestalt school disbanded, and its most prominent members emigrated to the United States. Today, the fundamental concept underlying Gestalt psychology—that the mind _interprets_ experiences in
predictable ways rather than simply reacts to them—is central to cognitive psychologists’ ideas about learning, memory, problem solving, and even psychotherapy.


INFORMATION-PROCESSING THEORY. The advent of the computer provided cognitive psychologists with a new way to conceptualize mental structures and processes
known as **information-processing theory** . According to this view, the brain processes
information in sequential steps, in much the same way as a computer does serial processing—that is, one step at a time. However, just as modern technology has changed
computers and computer programs, cognitive psychologists also have changed their
models. For example, many contemporary researchers are examining the human
memory system’s capacity for _parallel processing,_ the management of multiple bits of
information at once, a type of information processing that is commonly used in
today’s computers (Bajic & Rickard, 2009; Sung, 2008).
A central idea of information-processing theory, which it shares with Gestalt psychology, is that the brain interprets information rather than just responding to it. For
example, consider this statement: _The old woman was sweeping the steps_ . If informationprocessing researchers ask people who have read the sentence to recall whether it
includes the word _broom_, a majority will say that it does. According to informationprocessing theorists, rules for handling information lead us to find associations between new input, such as the statement about a woman sweeping, and previously
acquired knowledge, such as our understanding that brooms are used for sweeping.
As a result, most of us construct a memory of the sentence that leads us to incorrectly
recall that it includes the word _broom_ .
Designing computer programs that can process human language in the same way as
the human brain is one of the goals of research on _artificial intelligence_ . Today, such research
represents one of the most important applications of information-processing theory.


COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY TODAY. Over the past 100 years or so, cognitive psychologists have carried out studies that have greatly increased our knowledge of the human
memory system and the mental processes involved in problem solving. Moreover, the
principles discovered in these experiments have been used to explain and study all kinds
of psychological variables—from gender role development to individual differences in
intelligence. As a result, cognitive psychology is currently recognized as one of the most
prominent schools of psychological thought (Robins et al., 1999).




- Is this person having a bad day? The perceptual processes
described by the Gestalt psychologists are observable in everyday life.
We often put frustrating events—such as getting up late and then
having a flat tire—together to form a “whole” concept, such as “I’m
having a bad day.”

idea behind evolutionary
psychology?


- According to evolutionary
psychology, natural selection has
provided infants and caregivers with a
built-in genetic predisposition to form
an emotional attachment to one
another because such bonds help
infants survive.

how humans have adapted the behaviors required for survival in the
face of environmental pressures over
the long course of evolution.

psychology changing the
field of psychology?


**biological psychology** The school
of psychology that looks for links

equally specific biological processes
that often help explain individual
differences.


**neuroscience** An interdisciplinary
field that combines the work of psychologists, biologists, biochemists,
medical researchers, and others in
the study of the structure and function of the nervous system.



Evolutionary Psychology


Why do you think all healthy babies form attachments to their primary caregivers?
Why do you think most men prefer mates who are younger than they are? These are
the kinds of questions that interest _evolutionary psychologists_ . **Evolutionary psychology**
focuses on how the human behaviors required for survival have adapted in the face of
environmental pressures over the long course of evolution (Archer, 1996). As such,
evolutionary psychology draws heavily upon Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection. Darwin’s theory asserts that individual members of a given species who possess characteristics that help them survive
are the most likely to pass on the genes underlying those characteristics to subsequent generations. As a result, traits that
support individual survival become universal in the species; that is, every individual member of the species has them. For
example, every human being possesses the
capacity to acquire language. Natural selection would explain this universality as
the result of the survival advantage conferred upon humans by having an efficient
means of communicating information from
one person to another.
Evolutionary psychology has been
called, simply, a combination of evolutionary biology and cognitive psychology
(Barker, 2006; Evans & Zarate, 2000). Two
widely recognized proponents of evolutionary psychology, Leda Cosmides and
John Tooby, hold that this perspective combines the forces of evolutionary biology, anthropology, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. They explain that an evolutionary perspective can be applied to any topic
within the field of psychology (Tooby & Cosmides, 2005). For example, one of the most
influential evolutionary psychologists, David Buss, and his colleagues have conducted
a number of fascinating studies examining men’s and women’s patterns of behavior in
romantic relationships (1999, 2000a, 2000b, 2001, 2008). You’ll read more about Buss’s
work and that of his critics in Chapter 11.


Biological (Physiological) Psychology


Sometimes students are confused about the difference between evolutionary psychology and **biological psychology** (also referred to as _physiological psychology_ ). After all,
many think, isn’t evolution “biological” in nature? Yes, it is, but evolutionary psychology provides explanations of how certain biologically based behaviors came to be
common in an entire species. Consequently, it focuses on _universals_, traits that exist in
every member of a species. For instance, language is a human universal.
By contrast, biological psychologists look for links between specific behaviors and
particular biological factors that often help explain _individual differences_ . They study
the structures of the brain and central nervous system, the functioning of neurons, the
delicate balance of neurotransmitters and hormones, and the effects of heredity to look
for links between these biological factors and behavior. For example, the number of ear
infections children have in the first year of life (a _biological_ individual difference) is correlated with learning disabilities in the elementary school years (a _behavioral_ individual
difference) (Golz et al., 2005).
Many biological psychologists work under the umbrella of an interdisciplinary
field known as **neuroscience** . Neuroscience combines the work of psychologists, biologists, biochemists, medical researchers, and others in the study of the structure and
function of the nervous system. Important findings in psychology have resulted from
this work. For example, researchers have learned that defects in nerve cell membranes
interfere with the cells’ ability to make use of brain chemicals that help us control body


movement (Kurup & Kurup, 2002). These findings shed light on the physiological
processes underlying serious neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and
help pharmacological researchers in their efforts to create more effective medications
for these disorders. And the recently completed map of the human genome promises
to provide new explanations for many mental illnesses (Plomin et al., 2003).



The Sociocultural Approach







How do your background and cultural experiences affect your behavior and mental
processing? Just as important as the current trend toward biological explanations is
the growing realization among psychologists that social and cultural forces may be as
powerful as evolutionary and physiological factors. The **sociocultural approach** emphasizes social and cultural influences on human behavior and stresses the importance of understanding those influences when interpreting the behavior of others. For
example, several psychologists (e.g., Tweed & Lehman, 2002) have researched philosophical differences between Asian and Western cultures that may help explain crossnational achievement differences. (You will learn more about their findings in Chapter 7.)
Other socioculturally oriented psychologists have done studies that challenge the
view that Asians are a “model minority” whose cultural values enable most or all of
them to attain high levels of achievement no matter what kinds of environmental obstacles (e.g., poverty) are present in their lives (Lew, 2006).
Social and cultural influences on behavior are often studied within the broader
context of a _systems perspective_ . The primary idea behind the systems approach is that
multiple factors work together holistically; that is, their combined, interactive influences on behavior are greater than the sum of the individual factors that make up the
system. A good example of the systems approach may be found in a theory proposed
by psychologist Gerald Patterson and his colleagues that explains how variables interact to predispose some teenagers to antisocial behavior (Granic & Patterson, 2006).
This systems approach argues that poverty (a sociocultural factor), for example, is predictive of juvenile delinquency, but, in and of itself, it is insufficient to produce the behavior. As a result, most teens from poor families do not engage in antisocial behavior.
However, poverty may function as part of a system of influential variables that includes disengagement from school, association with peers who encourage antisocial
behavior, lack of parental supervision, and a host of other variables to increase the risk
of antisocial behavior for individual teenagers. At the same time, these variables interact to maintain themselves and, in some cases, to create a multigenerational cycle. For
instance, disengagement from school increases the likelihood that teenagers will live
in poverty when they reach adulthood. Poverty, in turn, increases the chances that
they will have to work long hours, rendering them less able to supervise their own
children’s behavior, thus putting another generation at risk for antisocial behavior.

how are they related to
an eclectic position?


**psychological perspectives**
General points of view used for
explaining people’s behavior and
thinking, whether normal or
abnormal.



Psychological Perspectives and Eclecticism


The views of modern psychologists are frequently difficult to categorize into traditional schools of thought. Thus, rather than discussing schools of thought, it is often more
useful to refer to **psychological perspectives** —general points of view used for explaining people’s behavior and thinking, whether normal or abnormal. So, for example, a
psychologist may adopt a behavioral perspective without necessarily agreeing with all
of Watson’s or Skinner’s ideas. What is important is that the psychologist taking such
a view will explain behavior in terms of environmental forces.
The major perspectives in psychology today and the kinds of variables each emphasizes in explaining behavior are as follows:




            - _Behavioral perspective_ —environmental factors


            - _Psychoanalytic perspective_ —emotions, unconscious motivations, early childhood
experiences


            - _Humanistic perspective_ —subjective experiences, intrinsic motivation to achieve selfactualization


            - _Cognitive perspective_ —mental processes


            - _Evolutionary perspective_ —inherited traits that enhance adaptability


            - _Biological perspective_ —biological structures, processes, heredity


            - _Sociocultural perspective_ —social and cultural variables

Studying for exams does not fit into the student’s
definition of a meaningful life.


The student does not use effective learning strategies
such as the SQ3R method.


The student believes that studying is unimportant
because potential mates are more interested in the

dominance than they are in grades.


An inappropriate level of emotional arousal (i.e., test
anxiety) is preventing the student from performing at
an optimal level.

Introduction to Psychology 15


Psychologists need not limit themselves to only one perspective or approach. Many
take an _eclectic_ (or integrative) _position,_ choosing a combination of approaches to explain
a particular behavior (Norcross, Karpiak, & Lister, 2005). For example, a psychologist
may explain a behavior in terms of both environmental factors and unconscious motivation. A child’s unruly behavior in school may be seen as maintained by teacher attention
(a behavioral explanation) but as initially caused by an emotional reaction to a family
event such as divorce (a psychoanalytic explanation). By adopting multiple perspectives, psychologists are able to devise more complex theories and research studies, resulting in improved treatment strategies. In this way, their theories and studies can more
closely mirror the behavior of real people in real situations.

Thinking about Theories and Research


Whenever we discuss theories, students want to know which are “true” and which are
“false.” However, psychologists and other scientists don’t think about theories in this
way. Instead, they evaluate theories in terms of their usefulness with regard to the scientific method. Remember, the scientific method involves a systematic approach to
finding answers to important questions and is an integral part of our everyday thinking. Still, we can all benefit from practicing it to a greater extent than we ordinarily do.
By practicing scientific thinking, we can develop a set of tools to use when we are confronted by sensational media reports about the results of a new study.



Evaluating Theories



**1.14** How do psycho
logists evaluate theories?



Sometimes students wonder why we should bother with theories. Why not just report
the facts, many ask. As you learned earlier in the chapter, theories provide us with explanations for facts, so they are indispensable to the scientific method. Clearly, though,
some theories do a better job of explaining data than others. There are several criteria
for determining this, what makes one theory useful and another less so.
The degree to which a theory leads to testable hypotheses is perhaps the most important criterion for judging its usefulness. When you use this standard to think about
the theories discussed so far, those of behaviorists and cognitive psychologists appear
more useful than those of psychoanalysts and humanists. B. F. Skinner’s prediction
that reinforcement increases behavior, for example, is far more testable than Maslow’s
claim that self-actualization is the highest of all human needs.
Useful theories also lead to the development of solutions to real-world problems.
For instance, research based on the information-processing model has resulted in the

**1.15** How can critical
thinking be used to interpret media reports of
psychological research?

objectively evaluating claims, propositions, and conclusions to determine
whether they follow logically from
the evidence presented.

Thinker. **www.mypsychlab.com**



development of practical strategies for improving memory. Similarly, even though
psychoanalytic and humanistic theories have been criticized for lacking testability,
they have produced a number of beneficial psychotherapies.
Hypotheses and practical applications are important, but a theory that possesses
_heuristic value_ is useful even if it falls short in these two areas. A theory that has heuristic value stimulates debate among psychologists and motivates both proponents and
opponents of the theory to pursue research related to it. In other words, a theory that
possesses heuristic value makes people think and spurs their curiosity and creativity.
All the theories discussed so far earn high marks for their heuristic value. In fact,
even if a theory has limited empirical support, professors who teach introductory psychology are justified in including it in the course if it has been of heuristic importance
in the field. This is why we still teach about the structuralists and functionalists, and
why we continue to rate Freud’s theory as one of the most important in the field.
Moreover, such theories usually affect students in the same way that they affect psychologists—that is, learning about them stimulates students’ thinking about behavior
and mental processes. Thus, introducing these theories helps professors achieve one of
their most important instructional goals, that of motivating students to think critically.


Evaluating Research


Another important goal of most professors who teach introductory psychology is to
equip students with the intellectual tools needed to evaluate claims based on psychological research. Living in the Information Age, we are bombarded with statistics and
claims of all types every day. For instance, a few years back the news media carried a
number of reports warning parents of young children that watching too much television
in the early years of life might lead to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
later in childhood (Clayton, 2004). These warnings were based, reporters said, on a scientific study that was published in the prestigious journal _Pediatrics_ . How can a person
who is not an expert on the subject in question evaluate claims such as these?
The thinking strategies used by psychologists and other scientists can help us sift
through this kind of information. **Critical thinking**, the foundation of the scientific
method, is the process of objectively evaluating claims, propositions, and conclusions
to determine whether they follow logically from the evidence presented. When we engage in critical thinking, we exhibit these characteristics:


- _Independent thinking._ When thinking critically, we do not automatically accept and
believe what we read or hear.

- _Suspension of judgment._ Critical thinking requires gathering relevant and up-todate information on all sides of an issue before taking a position.

- _Willingness to modify or abandon prior judgments._ Critical thinking involves evaluating new evidence, even when it contradicts preexisting beliefs.

**Explore** on **MyPsychLab**


Applying the first of these three characteristics to the television-ADHD study requires recognizing that the validity of any study is not determined by the authority of its
source. Prestigious journals—or psychology textbooks for that matter—shouldn’t be regarded as sources of fixed, immutable truths. In fact, learning to question accepted
“truths” is important to the scientific method itself. For example, for many years scientists believed that the brain did not develop any new nerve cells after birth. However,
once the technology became available to directly study neuronal development, researchers who were willing to challenge the status quo found that the brain produces
new nerve cells throughout the life span (Gould et al., 1999).
The second and third characteristics of critical thinking, suspension of judgment
and willingness to change, may require abandoning some old habits. If you are like
most people, you respond to media reports about research on the basis of your own
personal experiences, a type of evidence scientists call _anecdotal evidence._ For instance,
in response to the media report about television and ADHD, a person might say, “I
agree with that study because my cousin has such severe ADHD that he had to drop
out of high school, and he was always glued to the television when he was little.” Another might counter, “I don’t agree with that study because I watched a lot of television when I was a kid, and I don’t have ADHD.”


Suspension of judgment requires that you postpone either accepting or rejecting the
study’s findings until you have accumulated more evidence. It might involve determining what, if any, findings have been reported by other researchers regarding a possible
link between television viewing and ADHD. Analysis of other relevant studies can help
to create a comprehensive picture of what the entire body of research says about the issue.
Ultimately, when enough evidence has been gathered, a critical thinker must be willing to
abandon preconceived notions and prior beliefs that conflict with it.
Critical thinking strategies can also help us recognize **pseudoscience**, the distortion of theories and/or research for the purpose of supporting some kind of
claim. There is no widely accepted definition of pseudoscience that clearly distinguishes it from true science (McNally, 2003). However, there are several telltale
signs that critical thinkers can use to identify pseudoscientific claims (Lilienfeld,
Lynn, & Lohr, 2004). **Watch** on **MyPsychLab**
Imagine, for example, seeing a television commercial for “Rememberitol,” a (fictitious) nutritional supplement that claims to improve memory function. The ad consists of
a series of video clips showing people in situations where they are trying to remember
something. One clip features an older woman who has forgotten where she parked her car.
Another shows a college student trying to study. Yet another shows a middle-aged man
trying to remember a phone number. The voice-over says: “Rememberitol boosts memory
function by stimulating your brain’s memory cells. Rememberitol keeps these cells alert
and ready to latch on to information you need to remember whenever it comes along.”
In the next series of clips, satisfied Rememberitol customers make statements such
as, “I thought I was developing Alzheimer’s disease, but thanks to Rememberitol, I’m
back to my old self again,” and “My GPA went from 2.5 to 4.0 after I started taking Rememberitol,” and “I missed a big sale because I couldn’t remember my client’s phone
number. Thanks to Rememberitol, that’ll never happen again.” Finally, a woman wearing a white coat and standing in a laboratory is introduced as a “distinguished memory researcher.” She states that her studies show that Rememberitol improves memory
function and that viewers can access her results at Rememberitol.com.
Frankly, few of us would be fooled by the Rememberitol ad and we would file it
away in our mind’s “too good to be true” folder. But what is it about the ad that makes it
pseudoscientific? There are three strong indicators (Lilienfeld et al., 2004). First, the
phrase “your brain’s memory cells” gives Rememberitol the appearance of having some
basis in science. Second, the “distinguished memory researcher” directs viewers’ attention only to research that supports the claims of Rememberitol’s makers. An authentic scientific presentation of research would also point to studies showing that nutritional
supplementation does not improve memory function (e.g., DeKosky et al., 2008). So, like
the phrase “your brain’s memory cells,” the researcher’s endorsement employs the symbols of science but lacks its substance. Finally, the ad offers anecdotal evidence in support
of its claims, a type of evidence that, as we noted earlier, is subjective and unreliable.
As you can see, when it comes to knowing how to interpret the research findings
we hear and read about, critical thinking strategies are a useful intellectual tool. Understanding the methods that scientists use can provide us with still more help in evaluating media reports about research. In the next few sections we will introduce you to
several of those methods.

18 Chapter 1


**descriptive research methods**
Research methods that yield
descriptions of behavior.


**1.16** How do psychological researchers use
naturalistic and laboratory observation?


**naturalistic observation** A descriptive research method in which
researchers observe and record behavior in its natural setting, without
attempting to influence or control it.



Descriptive Research Methods


What is the simplest kind of research? Research that involves direct observation is usually easy to perform and often provides the clearest results. **Descriptive research**
**methods** yield descriptions of behavior and include naturalistic and laboratory observation, the case study, the survey, and the correlational method.


Naturalistic and Laboratory Observation




- Naturalistic observation plays an important role in studies
of animal behavior.



**laboratory observation** A descriptive research method in which
behavior is studied in a laboratory
setting, where researchers can exert
more control and use more precise
equipment to measure responses.


**case study** A descriptive research
method in which a single person or
a small number of individuals are
studied in great depth, usually over
an extended period of time.


**1.17** What are
the advantages and
disadvantages of the
case study?



Have you ever sat in an airport or shopping mall and simply watched what people
were doing? Such an activity is quite similar to **naturalistic observation**, a descriptive
research method in which researchers observe and record behavior in its natural setting, without attempting to influence or control it. The major advantage of naturalistic
observation is the opportunity to study behavior in normal settings, where it occurs
more naturally and spontaneously than it does under artificial and contrived laboratory conditions. Sometimes, naturalistic observation is the only feasible way to study behavior. For example, there is no other way to study how people typically react during
disasters such as earthquakes and fires.
Naturalistic observation has its limitations, however. Researchers must wait for
events to occur; they cannot speed up or slow down the process. And because they
have no control over the situation, researchers cannot reach conclusions about causeeffect relationships. Another potential problem with naturalistic observation is
_observer bias_, which is a distortion in researchers’ observations.
Observer bias can result when researchers’ expectations about
a situation cause them to see what they expect to see or to
make incorrect inferences about what they observe. Let’s say,
for example, that you’re a psychologist studying aggression in
preschool classrooms. You have decided to count every time a
child hits or pushes another child as an aggressive act. Your
decision to label this type of physical contact between children
as “aggressive” may cause you to notice more such acts and
label them as “aggressive” than you would if you were casually watching a group of children play. The effects of observer
bias can be reduced substantially when two or more observers
view the same behavior. So, if you and another observer independently count, say, 23 aggressive acts in an hour of free play,
the findings are considered unbiased. If, on the other hand,
you see 30 such acts and the other observer records only 15,
there is some kind of bias at work. In such situations, observers usually clarify the
criteria for classifying behavior and repeat the observations. Using videotapes can
also help eliminate observer bias because behavior can be reviewed several times
prior to making classification decisions.
Another method of studying behavior involves observation that takes place not in
its natural setting, but in a laboratory. Researchers using **laboratory observation** can
exert more control and use more precise equipment to measure responses. Much of
what is known about sleep or the human sexual response, for example, has been
learned through laboratory observation. However, like other research methods, laboratory observation has limitations. For one, laboratory behavior may not accurately reflect real-world behavior. For example, in sleep studies, some of the behavior people
display while asleep in the laboratory may not occur in their homes. As a result, conclusions based on laboratory findings may not generalize beyond the walls of the laboratory itself. Another disadvantage is that building, staffing, equipping, and
maintaining research laboratories can be expensive.



The Case Study


The **case study**, or case history, is another descriptive research method used by psychologists. In a case study, a single person or a small number of individuals are studied in great depth, usually over an extended period of time. A case study involves the
use of observations, interviews, and sometimes psychological testing. Exploratory in


nature, the case study’s purpose is to provide a detailed description of some behavior
or disorder. This method is particularly appropriate for studying people who have uncommon psychological or physiological disorders or brain injuries. Many case studies
are written about patients being treated for such problems. In some instances, the results of detailed case studies have provided the foundation for psychological theories.
In particular, the theory of Sigmund Freud was based primarily on case studies of his
patients.
Although the case study has proven useful in advancing knowledge in several
areas of psychology, it has certain limitations. Researchers cannot establish the cause
of behavior observed in a case study, and observer bias is a potential problem. Moreover, because so few individuals are studied, researchers do not know how applicable,
or generalizable, their findings may be to larger groups or to different cultures.



Survey Research







Have you ever been questioned about your voting behavior or about the kind of toothpaste you prefer? If you have, chances are that you were a participant in another kind
of research study. The **survey** is a descriptive research
method in which researchers use interviews and/or questionnaires to gather information about the attitudes, beliefs,
experiences, or behaviors of a group of people. The results of
carefully conducted surveys have provided valuable information about drug use, sexual behavior, and the incidence of
various mental disorders.

SELECTING A SAMPLE. Researchers in psychology rarely
conduct studies using all members of a group. For example,
researchers interested in studying the sexual behavior of
American women do not survey every woman in the United
States. (Imagine trying to interview about 140 million people!) Instead of studying the whole **population** (the entire
group of interest to researchers, to which they wish to apply
their findings), researchers select a sample for study. A
**sample** is a part of a population that is studied in order to
reach conclusions about the entire population.
Perhaps you have seen a carton of ice cream that contains
three separate flavors—chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla—
packed side by side. To properly sample the carton, you
would need a small amount of ice cream containing all three
flavors in the same proportions as in the whole carton—a
representative sample. A **representative sample** mirrors the
population of interest—that is, it includes important subgroups in the same proportions as they are found in that population (see the _Try It_ on page 20). A _biased sample_, on the
other hand, does not adequately reflect the larger population.
The best method for obtaining a representative sample is
to select a _random sample_ from a list of all members of the population of interest. Individuals are selected in such a way that
every member of the larger population has an equal chance
of being included in the sample. Using random samples,
polling organizations can accurately represent the views of
the American public with responses from as few as 1,000 people (O’Brien, 1996).




- Is the Hilton family _representative_ of the general population
of families in the United States? Why or why not?


- Internet surveys allow psychologists to gather lots of data from
large numbers of respondents in a very short period of time. But
how representative of the general population are people who
respond to Internet surveys? How representative are they of
Internet users in general? Questions such as these remain to
be answered.



INTERVIEWS AND QUESTIONNAIRES. Survey results can be affected by the questions’ wording and the context for the survey (Schwartz, 1999). Also, the truthfulness
of the responses can be affected by characteristics of the interviewers, such as their
gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion, social class, and accent. In general, people are
most inhibited when they give personal information to interviewers who are of the

**try it** CAN SMALL SAMPLES REALLY BE REPRESENTATIVE?

     - � �



Sometimes students have a hard time believing that
1,000 people or so can represent the entire population of the United States. This activity will help you
see that small samples can be representative. You
probably know that, when you flip a coin, the chance
of getting a head or a tail is 50%. This probability is
based on an infinite number of coin tosses. But how
well does tossing the coin twice represent that whole
population of tosses—that is, an infinite number of
tosses? If a sample of two tosses (or _n_ = 2, as a statistician would express it) doesn’t represent the whole
population, what about a sample of 5 or 10 or 15 or
20? To answer such a question, you have to take repeated samples of the same size. Toss a coin twice ( _n_
= 2), and then write the number of heads and tails in
the column labeled Sample 1. Repeat the process
four more times, recording your results under Sample
2 the second time, under Sample 3 the third time,



and so on, until you have a total of five samples,
each of which consists of two coin tosses. When
the _n_ = 2 row is completely filled in, calculate the
overall percentages of heads and tails. Next, use
the same process to collect data on samples of
_n_ = 5, _n_ = 10, _n_ = 15, and _n_ = 20, until you have
filled the table with data.
You can see that, as _n_ gets larger, the overall
percentages of heads and tails become more balanced (closer to 50/50). However, notice also that
_n_ = 20 isn’t much better than _n_ = 15, and it took a
lot longer to collect five samples of 20 coin tosses
each. In other words, there wasn’t much gain in
representativeness for the extra cost in time and
energy. So, small samples can be representative,
and increasing the size of a sample doesn’t always pay off when costs are balanced against
benefits.

same age but the opposite sex. Survey researchers, therefore, must select interviewers
who have personal characteristics that are appropriate for the intended respondents.
Questionnaires can be completed more quickly and less expensively than interviews, especially when respondents can fill them out in their homes or online. The Internet offers psychologists a fast and inexpensive way of soliciting participants and
collecting questionnaire data, and Internet surveys often generate large numbers of responses (Azar, 2000). For example, an Internet survey posted by researchers who
wanted to collect data about suicidal feelings attracted more than 38,000 respondents
from all over the world (Mathy, 2002). However, such surveys have problems, including technical glitches that sometimes prevent respondents from completing a questionnaire. Moreover, the sample is often biased in that it represents only the
population of Internet users who choose to participate in online research, _not_ the general population or even the population of Internet users. The critical point to remember is that surveys in which respondents _choose_ whether or not to participate—rather
than being selected through some kind of random process—are not scientific.


ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SURVEY RESEARCH. If conducted properly, surveys can provide highly accurate information. They can also track changes in
attitudes or behavior over time. For example, Johnston and others (2001) have tracked
drug use among high school students since 1975. However, large-scale surveys can be
costly and time-consuming. Another important limitation of survey research is that respondents may provide inaccurate information. False information can result from a
faulty memory or a desire to please the interviewer. Respondents may try to present
themselves in a good light (a phenomenon called the _social desirability response_ ), or they


may even deliberately mislead the interviewer. Finally, when respondents answer
questions about sensitive subjects, such as sexual behavior, they are often less candid
in face-to-face interviews than in self-administered or computerized questionnaires
(Tourangeau et al., 1997).



The Correlational Method







Perhaps the most powerful descriptive method available to psychologists is the
**correlational method**, a method used to establish the degree of relationship (correlation) between two characteristics, events, or behaviors. A group is selected for study,
and the variables of interest are measured for each participant. For example, one researcher might examine the relationship between attainment of a college degree and
subsequent income. Another might look for a correlation between the amount of time
students devote to studying and their grade point averages.
Correlations are not just important to scientists, but they are also common in our
everyday thinking. For example, what is the relationship between the price of a new
car and the social status you gain from owning it? Isn’t it true that as price goes up, status goes up as well? And isn’t status one of the variables that many people take into account when buying a new car? As this example illustrates, correlations are part of our
everyday lives, and we often use them in decision making.
When scientists study correlations, they apply a statistical formula to data representing two or more variables to obtain a _correlation coefficient_ . A **correlation coefficient**
is a numerical value that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between
two variables. A correlation coefficient ranges from 1.00 (a perfect positive correlation)+
to .00 (no relationship) to - 1.00 (a perfect negative correlation). The number in a
correlation coefficient indicates the relative strength of the relationship between two
variables—the higher the number, the stronger the relationship. Therefore, a correlation
of .85 is stronger than a correlation of .64.- +
The sign of a correlation coefficient ( + or   - ) indicates whether the two variables
vary in the same or opposite directions. A positive correlation indicates that two variables vary in the same direction, like the price of a car and its associated social status.
As another example, there is a positive though weak correlation between stress and illness. When stress increases, illness is likely to increase; when stress decreases, illness
tends to decrease (see FIGURE 1.2).
A negative correlation means that an increase in the value of one variable is associated with a decrease in the value of the other variable. For example, as mileage accu

Does the fact that there is a correlation between two

For instance, when two variables such as stress and illness are correlated, we cannot conclude that stress

Illness makes people sick. It might be that illness causes stress,

or that a third factor such as poverty or poor general
health causes people to be more susceptible to both illness and stress, as shown in FIGURE 1.3.
So, you might be thinking, if a researcher can’t draw

Illness

cause-effect conclusions, why do correlational studies?
There are three reasons. One reason is that it is sometimes impossible, for ethical reasons, to study variables
of interest using more direct methods. Scientists can’t
ethically ask pregnant women to drink alcohol just so
they can find out whether it causes birth defects. The only
option available in such cases is the correlational method.
Researchers have to ask mothers about their drinking
habits and note any association with birth defects in their
babies. Knowing the correlation between prenatal alcohol consumption and the incidence of birth defects helps scientists make predictions about what may happen when
pregnant women consume alcohol.
Another reason for using the correlational method is that many variables of interest to psychologists cannot be manipulated. Everyone wants to know whether biological sex (whether one is male or female) causes the differences we observe in men’s and
women’s behavior. But we can’t assign individuals to become male or female as we
might ask them to take a drug or a placebo. Again, the only option is to study the correlations between biological sex and particular variables of interest, such as cognitive
functioning and personality.
Finally, correlational studies can often be done fairly quickly. By contrast, as
you will learn in the section that follows, _experiments_ can be time-consuming and
complex. Still, the benefit of taking the time and trouble to carry out an experiment
is that the researcher can draw conclusions about cause-effect relationships
between variables. **Explore** on **MyPsychLab**

FIGURE 1.3 Correlation Does Not Prove Causation



A correlation between two variables does not prove that a cause-effect
relationship exists between them. There is a correlation between stress
and illness, but that does not mean that stress necessarily causes illness. Both stress and illness may result from another factor, such as
poverty or poor general health.

The Experimental Method


What comes to mind when you hear the word _experiment_ ? Many people use the word
to refer to any kind of study. Among psychologists, though, the term _experiment_ refers
only to one kind of study, the kind in which researchers seek to determine the causes
of behavior.



Experiments and Hypothesis Testing







The **experimental method**, or the experiment, is the _only_ research method that can be
used to identify cause-effect relationships. An experiment is designed to test a **causal**
**hypothesis** —a prediction about a cause-effect relationship between two or more variables. A _variable_ is any condition or factor that can be manipulated, controlled, or measured. One variable of interest to you is the grade you will receive in this psychology
course. Another variable that probably interests you is the amount of time you will
spend studying for this course. Do you suppose there is a cause-effect relationship between the amount of time students spend studying and the grades they receive? Consider two other variables: alcohol consumption and aggression. Alcohol consumption
and aggressive behavior are often observed occurring at the same time. But can we assume that alcohol consumption _causes_ aggressive behavior?
Alan Lang and his colleagues (1975) conducted a classic experiment to determine
if alcohol consumption itself increases aggression or if the beliefs or expectations about
the effects of alcohol cause the aggressive behavior. The participants in the experiment
were 96 male college students who were classified as heavy social drinkers. Half the
students were given plain tonic to drink; the other half were given a vodka-and-tonic
drink in amounts sufficient to raise their blood alcohol level to .10, which is higher
than the .08 level that is the legal limit for intoxication in most states. Participants were
assigned to four groups:


_Group 1:_ Expected alcohol, received only tonic
_Group 2:_ Expected alcohol, received alcohol mixed with tonic
_Group 3:_ Expected tonic, received alcohol mixed with tonic
_Group 4:_ Expected tonic, received only tonic



Introduction to Psychology 23


**1.20** Why do
researchers use
experiments to test
hypotheses about causeeffect relationships?


**experimental method** The only
research method that can be used to
identify cause-effect relationships
between two or more conditions
or variables.


**causal hypothesis** A prediction
about a cause-effect relationship
between two or more variables.



You might think that heavy social drinkers could detect the difference between
plain tonic and a one-to-five mixture of vodka and tonic. But during a preliminary
study, drinkers could distinguish between the two with no more than 50% accuracy
(Marlatt & Rohsenow, 1981).
After the students had consumed the designated amount, the researchers had an
accomplice, who posed as a participant, purposely provoke half the students by belittling their performance on a difficult task. All the students then participated in a
learning experiment, in which the same accomplice
posed as the learner. The subjects were told to administer an electric shock to the accomplice each
time he made a mistake on a decoding task. Each
participant was allowed to determine the intensity
and duration of the “shock.” (Although the students thought they were shocking the accomplice,
no shocks were actually delivered.) The researchers
measured the aggressiveness of the students in
terms of the duration and the intensity of the
shocks they chose to deliver.
What were the results of the experiment? As you
might imagine, the students who had been provoked gave the accomplice stronger shocks than
those who had not been provoked. But the students
who drank the alcohol were not necessarily the most
aggressive. Regardless of the actual content of their
drinks, the participants who thought they were
drinking alcohol gave significantly stronger shocks, - Under what conditions might the happy, party mood of these young
whether provoked or not, than those who assumed drinkers turn aggressive?

condition that is measured at the end

vary as a result of the manipulations
of the independent variable(s).

Independent and Dependent

**1.22** Why are experimental and control
groups necessary?


**experimental group** In an experiment, the group that is exposed to an
independent variable.



Recall that experiments test hypotheses about cause and effect. Examples of such
hypotheses include “Studying causes good grades” and “Taking aspirin causes
headaches to go away.” Note that each hypothesis involves two variables: One is
thought to be the cause (studying, taking aspirin), and the other is thought to be affected by the cause. These two kinds of variables are found in all experiments. An
experiment has at least one **independent variable** —a variable that the researcher
believes causes a change in some other variable. The researcher deliberately manipulates the independent variable (hypothesized cause) in order to determine
whether it causes any change in another behavior or condition. Sometimes the independent variable is referred to as the _treatment_ . The Lang experiment had two independent variables: the alcoholic content of the drink and the expectation of
drinking alcohol.
The second type of variable found in all experiments, the one that the hypothesis states is affected by the independent variable, is the **dependent variable** . It is
measured at the end of the experiment and is presumed to vary (increase or decrease) as a result of the manipulations of the independent variable(s). Researchers
must provide operational definitions of all variables in an experiment—that is, they
must specify precisely how the variables will be observed and measured. In the
Lang study, the dependent variable—aggression—was operationally defined as the
intensity and duration of the “shocks” the participants chose to deliver to the
accomplice. **Simulate** on **MyPsychLab**


Experimental and Control Groups


Most experiments are conducted using two or more groups of participants. There
must always be at least one **experimental group** —a group of participants who are exposed to the independent variable, or the treatment. The Lang experiment used three
experimental groups (see FIGURE 1.5).



Independent and Dependent Variables


Introduction to Psychology 25


FIGURE 1.5 Experimental
and Control Groups in the
Lang Experiment


The Lang experiment included three
experimental groups and one control
group.


**control group** In an experiment,
a group similar to the experimental
group that is exposed to the same
experimental environment but is
not given the treatment; used for
purposes of comparison.










|What Participants<br>What Participants Expected Received|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|V|Experimental group 1:<br>Expected alcohol,<br>received tonic|T<br>V<br>X|
|V|Experimental group 2:<br>Expected alcohol,<br>received alcohol<br>mixed with tonic|T<br>V<br>V|
|T|Experimental group 3:<br>Expected tonic,<br>received alcohol<br>mixed with tonic|T<br>V|
|T|Control group:<br>Expected tonic,<br>received tonic|T<br>V<br>X|



Most experiments also have a **control group** —a group that is similar to the experimental group and is also measured on the dependent variable at the end of the experiment, for purposes of comparison. The control group is exposed to the same
experimental environment as the experimental group but is not given the treatment.
The fourth group in the Lang study was exposed to neither of the two independent
variables; that is, this group did not expect alcohol and did not receive alcohol. Because this group was similar to the experimental groups and was exposed to the same
experimental environment, it served as a control group.
You may be wondering why a control group is necessary. Couldn’t an experimenter
just expose one group to the independent variable and see if there was a change? While
this approach is sometimes used, it is usually preferable to have a control group because
people and their behaviors often change without intervention. Having a control group
reveals what kinds of changes happen “naturally” and provides a way of separating the
effect of the independent variable from such changes. Say, for example, you want to find
out if a certain medication relieves headaches. You could just find some people with
headaches, give them the medication, and then find out how many still have headaches
an hour later. But some headaches go away without treatment. So if the medication appears to work, it may only be because a number of headaches went away on their own.
Having a control group allows you to know whether the medicine relieves headaches in
addition to those that disappear without treatment.

**1.23** What kinds of
factors introduce bias
into experimental
studies?


**confounding variables**
Factors or conditions other than the
independent variable(s) that are not
equivalent across groups and could
cause differences among the groups
with respect to the dependent
variable.


**selection bias** The assignment
of participants to experimental or
control groups in such a way that
systematic differences among the
groups are present at the beginning
of the experiment.


**random assignment** The process
of selecting participants for experimental and control groups by using
a chance procedure to guarantee that
each participant has an equal probability of being assigned to any of the
groups; a control for selection bias.


**placebo effect** The phenomenon
that occurs in an experiment when a
participant’s response to a treatment
is due to his or her expectations
about the treatment rather than
to the treatment itself.


**placebo** (pluh-SEE-bo) An inert
or harmless substance given to the
control group in an experiment as
a control for the placebo effect.


**experimenter bias** A phenomenon that occurs when a researcher’s
preconceived notions or expectations
in some way influence participants’
behavior and/or the researcher’s interpretation of experimental results.


**double-blind technique**
A procedure in which neither the
participants nor the experimenter
knows who is in the experimental
and control groups until after the
data have been gathered; a control
for experimenter bias.



Sources of Bias in Experimental Research


Can the researcher always assume that the independent variable is the cause of some
change in the dependent variable? Not necessarily. Sometimes an experiment is affected by **confounding variables** —factors or conditions other than the independent variable that are not equivalent across groups and that could cause differences among the
groups with respect to the dependent variable. By conducting their experiment in a
laboratory, Lang and his colleagues were able to control environmental conditions
such as extreme noise or heat, which could have acted as confounding variables by increasing aggressive responses. Three additional sources of confounding variables that
must be controlled in all experiments are selection bias, the placebo effect, and experimenter bias.


SELECTION BIAS. Why can’t researchers allow participants to choose to be in either
the experimental or control group? Such a procedure would introduce _selection bias_
into a study. **Selection bias** occurs when participants are assigned to experimental or
control groups in such a way that systematic differences among the groups are present
at the beginning of the experiment. If selection bias occurs, then differences at the end
of the experiment may not reflect the change in the independent variable but may be
due to preexisting differences in the groups. To control for selection bias, researchers
must use **random assignment** . This process consists of selecting participants by using
a chance procedure (such as drawing the names of participants out of a hat) to guarantee that each participant has an equal probability of being assigned to any of the
groups. Random assignment maximizes the likelihood that the groups will be as similar as possible at the beginning of the experiment. If there were pre-existing differences
in students’ levels of aggressiveness in the Lang experiment, random assignment
would have spread those differences across all the groups.


THE PLACEBO EFFECT. Can participants’ expectations influence an experiment’s results? Yes. The **placebo effect** occurs when a participant’s response to a treatment is
due to his or her expectations about the treatment rather than to the treatment itself.
Suppose a drug is prescribed for a patient and the patient reports improvement. The
improvement could be a direct result of the drug, or it could be a result of the patient’s
expectation that the drug will work. Studies have shown that sometimes patients’ remarkable improvement can be attributed solely to the power of suggestion—the placebo
effect.
In drug experiments, the control group is usually given a **placebo** —an inert or
harmless substance such as a sugar pill or an injection of saline solution. To control for
the placebo effect, researchers do not let participants know whether they are in the experimental group (receiving the treatment) or in the control group (receiving the placebo). If participants getting the real drug or treatment show a significantly greater
improvement than those receiving the placebo, then the improvement can be attributed to the drug rather than to the participants’ expectations about the drug’s effects.
In the Lang experiment, some students who expected alcohol mixed with tonic were
given only tonic. The tonic without alcohol functioned as a placebo, allowing researchers to measure the effect of the expectations alone in producing aggression.


EXPERIMENTER BIAS. What about the experimenter’s expectations? **Experimenter**
**bias** occurs when researchers’ preconceived notions or expectations become a selffulfilling prophecy and cause the researchers to find what they expect to find. A researcher’s expectations can be communicated to participants, perhaps unintentionally,
through tone of voice, gestures, or facial expressions. These communications can influence the participants’ behavior. Expectations can also influence a researcher’s interpretation of the experimental results, even if no influence occurred during the
experiment. To control for experimenter bias, researchers must not know which participants are assigned to the experimental and control groups until after the research data
are collected and recorded. (Obviously, someone assisting the researcher does know.)
When neither the participants nor the researchers know which participants are getting
the treatment and which are in the control group, the experiment is using the **double-**
**blind technique** .


Introduction to Psychology 27


**1.24** What are
the limitations of the
experimental method?



Limitations of the Experimental Method







You now know that experiments provide information about cause-effect relationships.
But what are their limitations? For one thing, researchers who use the experimental
method are able to exercise strict control over the setting, but the more control they exercise, the more unnatural and contrived the research setting becomes. And the more
unnatural the setting becomes, the less generalizable findings may be to the real
world. Another important limitation of the experimental method is that its use is either
unethical or impossible for research in many areas of interest to psychologists. Some
treatments cannot be given to human participants because their physical or psychological health would be endangered or their constitutional rights violated.
What happens when we apply our knowledge about the problems associated with
the experimental method to the results of Lang’s study? Can we conclude that people
in general tend to be more aggressive when they believe they are under the influence
of alcohol? Before reaching such a conclusion, we must consider several factors: (1) All
participants in this experiment were male college students. We cannot be sure that the
same results would have occurred if females or males of other ages had been included.
(2) The participants in this experiment were classified as heavy social drinkers. Would
the same results have occurred if nondrinkers, moderate social drinkers, or alcoholics
had been included? To apply this experiment’s findings to other groups, researchers
would have to replicate, or repeat, the experiment using different populations of subjects. (3) The amount of alcohol given to the students was just enough to bring their
blood alcohol level to .10. We cannot be sure that the same results would have occurred if they had consumed more or less alcohol.

this chapter.

Participants in Psychological Research


You have learned about observer and experimenter bias in research, but were you
aware that the findings of a study can be biased by the participants themselves? Furthermore, researchers are bound by ethical guidelines that specify how participants
and animal subjects are supposed to be treated.


Participant-Related Bias in Psychological Research


Do you remember reading earlier about the importance of representative samples in survey research? With other methods, representativeness becomes an issue when psychologists want to generalize the findings of studies to individuals other than the studies’
participants. For example, projections by the U.S. Census Bureau (2000) indicate that the
percentage of non-Hispanic Whites in the U.S. population is expected to decrease from
71.5% in the year 2000 to 53% in 2050. Yet, Whites are often overrepresented in psychological studies because the majority of studies with human participants in the last 30
years have drawn from the college student population (Graham, 1992), which has a
lower proportion of minorities than the population in general. Moreover, college students, including those of minority ethnicity, are a relatively select group in terms of age,
socioeconomic class, and educational level. Thus, they are not representative of the general population. This lack of representativeness in a research sample is a type of
_participant-related bias_ .
Gender bias is another type of participant-related bias. For example, Ader and
Johnson (1994) found that, when conducting research in which all of the participants
are of one sex, researchers typically specify the gender of the sample clearly when it is
female but not when the sample is exclusively male. Such a practice, according to Ader
and Johnson, reveals a “tendency to consider male participants ‘normative,’ and results obtained from them generally applicable, whereas female participants are somehow ‘different,’ and results obtained from them are specific to female participants”
(pp. 217–218). On a positive note, however, these researchers report that over the
decades, gender bias in the sampling and selection of research subjects has been decreasing.
Another kind of bias happens when researchers, or consumers of research, overgeneralize the findings of a study to all members of a particular group. For example,
Sandra Graham (1992) reported finding a methodological flaw—failure to include socioeconomic status—in much of the research literature comparing White Americans
and African Americans. Graham pointed out that African Americans are overrepresented among the economically disadvantaged. She maintained that socioeconomic
status should be incorporated into research designs “to disentangle race and social
class effects” in studies that compare White and African Americans (p. 634).
Ageism is another continuing source of participant-related bias and is especially
apparent in the language used in psychological research (Schaie, 1993). For example,
the titles of research studies on aging often include words such as _loss, deterioration, de-_
_cline,_ and _dependency_ . Moreover, researchers are likely to understate the great diversity
among the older adults they study. According to Schaie, “most research on adulthood


shows that differences between those in their 60s and those in their 80s are far greater
than those between 20- and 60-year-olds” (p. 50). Researchers should guard against
using descriptions or reaching conclusions that imply that all members of a given age
group are defined by negative characteristics.



Protecting Research Participants’ Rights







Researchers are ethically obligated to protect the rights of all study participants. In
2002, the American Psychological Association (APA) adopted a new set of ethical standards governing research with human participants so as to safeguard their rights
while supporting the goals of scientific inquiry. Following are some of the main provisions of the code:


- _Legality._ All research must conform to applicable federal, state, and local laws and
regulations.

- _Institutional approval._ Researchers must obtain approval from all institutions involved in a study. For example, a researcher cannot conduct a study in a school
without the school’s approval.

- _Informed consent._ Participants must be informed of the purpose of the study and its
potential for harming them. Researchers can deviate from this standard of informed consent only when they have a justifiable reason for doing so. Typically, an
institutional committee examines whether there is justification for deceiving participants in a study. Most such committees find, for instance, that the use of placebos doesn’t violate this standard because a placebo control group enables
experimenters to more effectively measure the effects of a treatment by controlling
for participants’ expectations.

- _Deception._ Deception of participants is ethical when it is necessary. However, the
code of ethics cautions researchers against using deception if another means can be
found to test the study’s hypothesis.

- _Debriefing._ Whenever a researcher deceives participants, including through the
use of placebo treatments, he or she must tell participants about the deception as
soon as the study is complete.

- _Clients, patients, students, and subordinates._ When participants are under another’s
authority (for example, a therapist’s client, a patient in a hospital, a student in a
psychology class, or an employee), researchers must take steps to ensure that participation in a study, and the information obtained during participation, will not
damage the participants in any way. Professors, for example, cannot reduce students’ grades if the students refuse to participate in a research study.

- _Payment for participation._ Participants can be paid, but the code of ethics requires
that they be fully informed about what is expected in return for payment. In addition, researchers are to refrain from offering excessive payments that may bias the
study’s participants in some way.

- _Publication._ Psychological researchers must report their findings in an appropriate
forum, such as a scientific journal, and they must make their data available to others who want to verify their findings. Even when a study produces no findings, its
results must still be reported; in such cases, the appropriate forum is the institution
that sponsored the research, the organization in which the research was conducted, or the agency or foundation that funded it. Results must also be made available to participants. **Simulate** on **MyPsychLab**



The Use of Animals in Research







The new APA code of ethics also includes guidelines for using animals in psychological research. Here are a few of the important provisions:


- _Legality._ Like research with human participants, animal research must follow all
relevant federal, state, and local laws.

used in research?


30 Chapter 1




             - _Supervision by experienced personnel._ The use of animals must be supervised by people who are trained in their care. These experienced personnel must teach all subordinates, such as research assistants, how to properly handle and feed the
animals and to recognize signs of illness or distress.


             - _Minimization of discomfort._ Researchers are ethically bound to minimize any discomfort to research animals. For example, it is unethical to perform surgery on research animals without appropriate anesthesia. And when researchers must
terminate the lives of research animals, they must do so in a humane manner.


Even with these safeguards in place, the use of animals in research is controversial. Many animal rights advocates want all animal research stopped immediately.
Books on animal rights devote an average of 63.3% of their content to the use of animals in research (Nicholl & Russell, 1990). Yet, of the approximately 6.3 million animals killed each year in the United States, only 0.3% are used in research and
education, while 96.5% are used for food, 2.6% are killed by hunters, 0.4% are killed in
animal shelters, and 0.2% are used for fur garments (Christensen, 1997).
In a survey of almost 4,000 randomly selected members of the APA, “80% of respondents expressed general
support for psychological research on animals” (Plous,
1996, p. 1177). Among the general public, support for animal research is higher when the research is tied to human
health and highest when the animals involved in such research are rats and mice rather than dogs, cats, or primates (Plous, 1996). Most agree that there are at least six
reasons for using animals in research: (1) They provide a
simpler model for studying processes that operate similarly in humans; (2) researchers can exercise far more control over animal subjects and thus be more certain of their
conclusions; (3) a wider range of medical and other manipulations can be used with animals; (4) it is easier to
study the entire life span and even multiple generations
in some animal species; (5) animals are more economical

want to learn more about the animals themselves.
Is animal research really necessary? Virtually all of the marvels of modern medicine
are at least partially the result of experimentation using animals. Animal research has
yielded much knowledge about the brain and the physiology of vision, hearing, and the
other senses (Domjan & Purdy, 1995). It has also increased knowledge in the areas of
learning, motivation, stress, memory, and the effects on the unborn of various drugs ingested during pregnancy. Similarly, animal research has helped psychopharmacologists
better understand the side effects of drugs that are used to relieve the symptoms of serial
mental illnesses such as schizophrenia (Ortega-Alvaro, Gilbert-Rahola, & Micó, 2006).
Overall, the animal rights controversy has had a positive effect on research ethics:
It has served to increase concern for the treatment of animals as research subjects and
to stimulate a search for alternative research methods that is reportedly resulting in a
decrease in the numbers of animals needed (Mukerjee, 1997, p. 86).

Psychologists at Work


Psychology is a fascinating field. So fascinating, in fact, that many people choose careers
that involve learning more about human behavior and mental processes or using psychological principles to improve people’s lives. Most such careers require graduate degrees, but there are many job opportunities for undergraduate psychology majors, too.



Specialties in Psychology







Wherever you find human activity, you are very likely to encounter psychologists.
These professionals work in a number of specialties, most of which require a master’s
or a doctoral degree. **Explore** on **MyPsychLab**


- _Clinical psychologists_ specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental and behavioral disorders, such as anxiety, phobias, and schizophrenia. Some also conduct
research in these areas.


- _School psychologists_ are clinical psychologists who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of learning and
behavioral problems that interfere with learning.


- _Forensic psychologists_ apply their training in clinical
psychology to issues involving psychology and law.


- _Counseling psychologists_ help people who have adjustment problems (marital, social, or behavioral)
that are generally less severe than those handled by
clinical psychologists.


- _Physiological psychologists_, also called _biological psy-_
_chologists_ or _neuropsychologists,_ study the relationship between physiological processes and behavior.


- _Experimental psychologists_ conduct experiments in
most areas of psychology—learning, memory, sensation, perception, motivation, emotion, and others.


- _Developmental psychologists_ study how people grow,
develop, and change throughout the life span.

teaching and learning. (Note: Do not confuse educational psychology with school psychology. Recall that school psychology is the
subfield of clinical psychology that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of
learning problems. Educational psychologists study learning in typically developing people. As such, they are trained in theory and research methods but not in the
diagnosis and treatment of learning problems.)


- _Social psychologists_ investigate how the individual feels, thinks, and behaves in a
social setting—in the presence of others.


- _Industrial/organizational (I/O) psychologists_ study the relationships between people
and their work environments.



Majoring in Psychology







Have you considered majoring in psychology? Many students do. In fact, the number of undergraduate degrees awarded in psychology is surpassed only by the
number awarded in business administration and education (NCES, 2008).
As mentioned earlier, professional psychologists have graduate degrees. The
American Psychological Association reports that it takes about 5 years of study beyond the bachelor’s degree to obtain a doctoral degree in psychology (APA, 2000).
However, there are many jobs open to those with a bachelor’s degree in psychology,
and most such jobs are found in for-profit companies (National Science Foundation,
2000). PayScale, an organization that tracks applicant qualifications across a wide

variety of employment settings, reports that the most popular jobs for people with
undergraduate degrees in psychology are administrative assistant, retail manager,
social services case manager, and human resources manager (PayScale, Inc., 2009). In
addition, many men and women who intend to go on to postgraduate work in other
fields—law, for example—major in psychology.
You may have wondered what kinds of courses are offered for psychology majors.
One of the purposes of an introductory course in psychology is to survey the subfields
in which more advanced courses are offered (Brewer et al., 1993). The contents of this
textbook provide a good guide to the kinds of courses you would take if you majored
in psychology. TABLE 1.1 provides an overview of the various components of a bachelor’s degree program in psychology.
