# **Self Help for Anxiety**


  - Do you find that you spend large periods of the day worrying?

  - Do you often feel nervous, apprehensive or on edge?

  - Do you feel that things are getting on top of you?

  - Do you find it hard to relax and 'switch off'?

  - Do you often experience unpleasant physical sensations such as 'butterflies' in your
stomach, muscular tension, dizziness or breathlessness?


If the answer to any of these questions is 'yes', you may be experiencing symptoms of
anxiety and you may find this workbook helpful.


This workbook aims to help you to:


  - Recognise whether you may be experiencing symptoms of anxiety.

  - Understand what anxiety is, what causes it and what keeps it going.

  - Find ways to understand, manage or overcome your anxiety.

# **What is anxiety?**

Anxiety is an unpleasant feeling that we all experience at times. It is a word often used to
describe when we feel 'uptight', 'irritable', 'nervous', 'tense', or 'wound up'. When we are anxious
we normally experience a variety of uncomfortable physical sensations. These include:


  - Increased heart rate

  - Muscular tension

  - Sweating

  - Trembling

  - Feelings of breathlessness


As well as this, anxiety affects us mentally too. For example, when anxious, we often worry for
large periods of time, so much so that our worry can feel out of control. These worries are often
about a variety of issues and commonly our mind jumps quickly from one worry to another.

Anxiety also influences how we behave. For instance, when we feel anxious, we often avoid
doing things that we want to because we are worried about how they will turn out. Although
short experiences of anxiety are part and parcel of daily life, it becomes challenging when
anxiety begins to follow people around and is a regular feature in their lives.


# **What causes anxiety?**

_Life Events:_ Often we develop anxiety following a series of stressful life
events. This is especially true if we experience many different
pressures all at once. For example, if someone has work
pressures, financial difficulties, and relationship problems, all at
the same time, it is perhaps unsurprising that they become
anxious. When thinking about it in this way, anxiety is often the
result of feeling as though we cannot cope with the demands
placed upon us.


In addition, people can learn to be anxious based on their life
experiences. For example, if someone has faced workplace
bullying in the past, they may be more likely to suffer anxiety when
beginning a new job.


_Thinking Styles:_ Some people may have a thinking style that lends
itself to experiencing anxiety. For example, anxious
people have a tendency to expect that the worst
possible scenario will always occur. They also feel
like they must constantly be on guard in case
something bad happens. They believe that by thinking
about all the things that could go wrong, they will be better
prepared to cope if it happens. However thinking in these
ways mean they are on regular alert and find it difficult to
relax and 'switch off'.


_Evolutionary Reasons:_ _W_ e also experience anxiety because of its evolutionary
benefits. Put another way, although anxiety is largely an
unpleasant experience, it also has positive benefits that
have been useful to humans over the centuries. For
example, when we are under threat or feel in danger (e.g.
hear a burglar), we automatically become anxious. As a
result, our heart beats more quickly which supplies blood to
our muscles (which helps us run away from or fight the
burglar); we sweat (which cools us down during this
process); and our breathing changes (which ensures
oxygen is delivered to our muscles quickly, again preparing
us for a quick response). When looking at anxiety in this
way, you can quickly see how it can be very useful in
certain situations.


_Biological Reasons:_ It has also been suggested that anxiety has familial
ties. In other words, if someone in your immediate
family is an anxious person, there is an increased
chance that you will have similar personality traits.


In reality it is likely that a combination of all these factors influence someone's anxiety levels.
However, in some ways it is less important to know what causes anxiety, and more important to
know what stops us overcoming it.


# **What keeps our anxiety going?**

Some people have a style of thinking which lends itself to experiencing anxiety. For example, it
appears that some people are more likely to overestimate the likelihood of bad things
happening than others. It is easy to see how regularly presuming the worst in this way would
make someone feel anxious. Unfortunately, when we do feel anxious, we become even less
likely to think as clearly as we would like and a vicious cycle occurs.


Anxious people also sometimes believe that worrying has a protective function. More
specifically, they believe that being on the 'look out' for danger can help them to recognise and
avoid it. Unfortunately, when searching for danger in this way, they soon begin seeing potential
danger in many relatively safe situations which of course makes them feel anxious. They may
also believe that by considering everything that could go wrong; they will be better prepared to
cope when it does. However, often these beliefs mean a lot of extra time is spent worrying than
is necessary, as many of our worries never come true. Of course, the more time we spend
worrying, the more anxious we feel.


Another way someone's thinking style can keep their anxiety going is because they become
'worried about worrying'. Here, people tend to worry that they are doing harm to themselves
(e.g. going mad) by worrying so often (which is not the case) and a vicious cycle occurs.
Similarly, people often worry about the physical symptoms they experience when they are
anxious (e.g. breathlessness, rapid heart rate etc). Unfortunately, worrying about these
symptoms (which are perfectly safe and natural bodily reactions), only makes them feel worse,
again creating a vicious cycle of anxiety.


One other important factor that can keep people's anxiety going is that they often change their
behaviour as a result of their anxiety. For example, they may avoid going to a party because
they have spotted many potential 'dangers' (e.g. “what if no one likes me”). Similarly, they may
put off completing an assignment because they worry about it being negatively evaluated.
Unfortunately because people tend to use such avoidance strategies, they can never see that
things would often go better than they thought and their anxiety remains as a result.


Not having enough free time to relax and do the things we enjoy we can also contribute to our
higher anxiety levels. On the other hand, having too much free time can mean we have lots of
opportunities to engage in worry and feel anxious.


When looking more closely at anxiety, you can begin to see that our thoughts, feelings,
behaviours and physical symptoms all interact and combine to keep our anxiety going. See the
diagram overleaf.


# **How can I reduce my anxiety?**

Fortunately, there are a number of strategies that we can use to reduce our anxiety. These
include:


1. Understanding more about anxiety.
2. Learning how to challenge your unhelpful thoughts and see things in a more realistic
light.
3. Improving your problem solving skills.
4. Learning how to reduce the amount of time you spend worrying.
5. Learning how you can feel more relaxed (physically and mentally).
6. Learning how to stop avoiding the things that make you anxious.


When going through this booklet it can sometimes be more helpful to try out the ideas above
one at a time, rather and trying to learn them all at once. However simply take things at your
own pace.


# **Understanding anxiety**

Anxiety is undoubtedly an unpleasant feeling, but it is something that everyone experiences. Of
course, some people experience anxiety more regularly than others, but it is a completely
natural experience that is part and parcel of daily life. Due to the unpleasant nature of anxiety,
people often worry that experiencing it is harmful. For example they may fear that regularly
worrying will make them go mad or that the physical symptoms of anxiety (e.g. heart racing) are
signs of a serious health problem. Such fears naturally make people even more anxious which
creates a vicious cycle of anxiety.


However, when exploring anxiety more closely, we can see that it is a very healthy response
which actually helps to protect us. By learning more about anxiety and why we experience it in
the first place, we can see that it is not harmful. This can help us to be less fearful of the
symptoms which in turn has a positive affect on our overall anxiety levels. If however you are
concerned that some of your symptoms are not caused by anxiety, contact your GP if
necessary.


The symptoms we experience when anxious are often referred to as the 'fight or flight'
response. This comes from the idea that people primarily experience anxiety to help them either
fight or run away from danger. For example, if you saw a burglar, two options open to you would
be to either - fight them off (fight) or try to run away (flight). Our fight or flight response would
kick in to help us at this point. For example:


  - Our hearts would begin beating more quickly
(supplying blood to our muscles).

  - We would sweat (to cool us down).

  - Our muscles would become tense (ready for action).

  - We would take deeper breaths (to supply oxygen to
our muscles).


In essence, all of these responses would aid our escape or
improve our ability to stay and fight the intruder. When
considered in this way, we can see how the symptoms of
anxiety are helpful to us. Indeed, all of the physical
symptoms we experience when anxious play a helpful role
in protecting us in such circumstances.


This fight or flight response was likely even more vital to
human survival back in the days of early man, when people had to hunt for their food and were
under a greater threat from predators. Nowadays we do not face the same threats, but
unfortunately, our bodies and minds have not caught up with these changes. As a result, we
now experience anxiety in situations where it is not necessarily as helpful because we cannot
fight or run away from them (e.g. work or financial pressures). However, the one thing that has
stayed true is the fact that these symptoms are not dangerous; it is in many ways the right
response but at the wrong time. Remembering this can help you to be less fearful of the
symptoms of anxiety which will allow them to pass sooner.


# **Challenging unhelpful thoughts**

The way that we think about things has an impact on our anxiety levels. Many of these thoughts
occur outside of our control, and can be negative or unhelpful. It is therefore important to
remember that they are just thoughts, without any real basis, and are not necessarily facts.
Even though we may believe a lot of our unhelpful thoughts when we are anxious, it is good to
remember that they should be questioned as they are often based on wrong assumptions.


The following section will help you begin to recognise if you are thinking about things in an
unhelpful or unrealistic way, and discuss how you can start to make changes to this. By doing
so, you can learn to see things in a more realistic light which can help to reduce your anxiety
levels. You might have unhelpful thoughts about all kinds of things. Here are some examples:


Being judged negatively by others:


  - They think I'm useless

  - They won't like me


Being unable to cope:


  - I'll make a fool of myself

  - I'm too anxious to manage that

  - I'll have a panic attack


Something terrible happening:


  - What if I have an accident?

  - What if I lose my job?


It is clear to see how this kind of thinking might
make us anxious. Do you ever think in any of the
ways outlined above?

Fill in your examples below:


You might find it difficult to identify an unhelpful thought. Try thinking about a time when you
were feeling anxious. Consider what was running through your mind at that time.


**Patterns of unhelpful thinking**

First you need to be able to recognise an unhelpful thought. Then you can challenge it.
Being aware of the common patterns that unhelpful thoughts follow can help you to
recognise when you have them. Here are some of the common patterns that our
unhelpful thoughts follow:

_Predicting the Future:_ When we are feeling anxious, it is common for us to spend
a lot of time thinking about the future and predicting what
could go wrong, rather than just letting things be. In the
end most of our predictions don't happen and we have
wasted time and energy being worried and upset about
them.

For example:

                  - Assuming you will perform poorly at your job interview.

                  - Spending the week before an exam predicting you will
fail, despite all your hard work studying and your
previous good grades.

_Mind Reading:_ This means that you make assumptions about others'
beliefs without having any real evidence to support them.

For example:

                  - My boss thinks I'm stupid.

                  - People think I'm weird.

Such ways of thinking naturally make us apprehensive.

_Catastrophising:_ People commonly 'catastrophise' when they are anxious,
which basically means that they often blow things out of
proportion.

For example:

                  - They assume that something that has happened is far
worse than it really is (e.g. that their friend is going to
dislike them because they cancelled a night out).

                  - They may think that something terrible is going to
happen in the future, when, in reality, there is very
little evidence to support it (e.g. I'm going to get into
serious trouble for calling in sick).

_Focusing on the Negatives:_ Anxious people often have a tendency to focus on the

negatives which keeps their anxiety going.

For example:

                    - They focus on the one person at work who doesn't
like them, ignoring that they are very popular with
the rest of their colleagues.


_Should Statements:_ People often imagine how they would like things to be or
how they 'should be' rather than accepting how things really
are.

For example:

                    - I should have got an A in History.

                    - I should never be anxious.


Unfortunately when we do this, we are simply applying extra
pressure to ourselves that can result in anxiety. Instead it can
sometimes help to accept that things can't always be perfect.

_Over Generalising:_ Based on one isolated incident you assume that all others will
follow a similar pattern in the future.

For example:

                    - When enrolling on a college course, you meet a
future classmate who you find irritating. As a result,
you worry that everyone in the class will be the
same and you won't make any friends.

_What If Statements:_ Have you ever wondered "what if" something bad happens?

For example

                    - What if I have a panic attack at the party?

                    - What if I don't make friends when I start my new
job?


This type of thought can often make us avoid going places or
doing the things that we would like.

_Labelling:_ Do you find that you attach negative labels to yourself?

For example:

                    - I'm weak.

                    - I'm a waste of space.

                    - I'm always anxious.


Labels like these really influence how we see ourselves and can heighten our anxiety levels.
Do any of your unhelpful thoughts follow some of these patterns? Jot down any examples you
can think of into the box below:


We can learn techniques to challenge these unhelpful thoughts. This can help to reduce your
anxiety levels. The next part of this handout will discuss how we can go about challenging our
unhelpful thoughts. You may come up with a more balanced thought that is accurate and based
on evidence.


**How to challenge unhelpful thoughts**

Once you have recognised an unhelpful thought the next stage is to challenge it. To do this, you
can ask yourself a serious of questions. See the example below:


_Situation: The end of year exams are approaching._


_How you feel: Nervous, stressed and apprehensive._
_Unhelpful thought: I'll definitely fail my exams miserably!_


**Challenges to an unhelpful thought**

Now you can challenge your unhelpful thoughts by asking these questions.


_**Is there any evidence that contradicts this thought?**_

      - I've always done well in my previous exams.

      - I've been scoring well in my coursework.

_**Can you identify any of the patterns of unhelpful thinking described earlier?**_

      - I'm 'predicting the future'. I have no evidence to suggest I'll fail.



_**What would you say to a friend who had this thought in a similar situation?**_




  - I'd say don't be silly, you've always done well. As long as you've studied hard,
you should be fine. Besides, you can only try your best.

_**What are the costs and benefits of thinking in this way?**_




  - Costs: It's making me feel sick with worry.

  - Benefits: I can't really think of any.

_**How will you feel about this in 6 months time?**_




  - I'll probably look back and laugh about how silly I was being.

_**Is there another way of looking at this situation?**_

  - I've always done well in the past so I should be ok. I can only do my best
anyway; after all I've studied hard. At worst, I'll just have to re-sit next year.



Once you have asked yourself these questions, you should read through your answers. Try to
come up with a more balanced or rational view. For example:


_**Worrying about failing is doing me no good. I've always done well before**_
_**so I should be fine, especially since I've prepared properly.**_


Try to apply these questions to the unhelpful thoughts that you notice. It can help to reduce your
anxiety levels. You can use this technique to test your thoughts are realistic and balanced.


# **Problem Solving**

You might find it more difficult to cope if you have lots of problems that you can't seem to get on
top of. This can have a clear impact on our anxiety levels. Struggling with unresolved problems
can often make us feel worse. We can end up worrying or ruminating over our problems without
finding a way to resolve them. This can make us feel even more upset, and can end up
interfering with our sleep.

It can help to develop a structured way of working through a problem. Beginning to overcome
some of your problems might help you to feel better. You can improve your problem solving
skills by learning to apply the steps outlined here.


**Identify your problem**

The first thing to ask yourself is “what is the problem?” Try to be as specific as possible.

For example:

      - "I owe £400 to my friend”

      - "I am going to miss this deadline."


**Come up with possible solutions**

Try to list every way that you can think to overcome your problem. Don't worry about
how unrealistic an idea seems. Write down anything and everything. The best
solutions are likely to be the ones you think of yourself. This is because nobody really
knows your situation as well as you do.

It may help to consider:

      - How you might have solved similar problems in the past.

      - What your friends or family would advise.

      - How you would like to see yourself tackling the problem.


**Choose a solution**


Next you need to select the best solution from your list. Think carefully about each
option. It is useful to go through all the reasons 'for' and 'against' each idea. This will
help you to make a good decision and select the best solution.

After this you may find that you are still unsure. Perhaps a couple of approaches seem
equally good. Try to pick one to begin with. If it doesn't work then you can always go
back and try out a different one later.


**Break down your solution**

To help you carry out your chosen solution, it can be useful to break it down into
smaller steps. This can make it easier and more manageable to follow through. The
number of steps required will vary depending on the solution and how complex it is.

For example: Someone with debt may have decided to try and resolve their problem
by getting a part time job. This would require several steps.


1. Buying a newspaper with job adverts.
2. Choosing which jobs to apply for.
3. Creating a CV.
4. Sending out their CV.
5. Buying interview clothes.
6. Preparing answers to potential interview questions.


**Try out your solution and review the outcome**

Follow the steps required to carry out your solution. Simply take them one at a time.
Go at your own pace and don't allow yourself to feel too rushed.

Once you have completed all the steps, you should then review the outcome. If you
have successfully resolved your problem then great. If the problem still exists then
don't give up.


        - Is there another solution on your list that you could try?

        - Is there a different solution that you have yet to consider?

        - Can you ask someone else if they have any ideas or advice?

        - Can you combine any of your solutions?


It is useful to remember that not all problems are within our control. This can make it really
difficult if not impossible to resolve using the steps above. Perhaps you will have to wait,
or ask someone else to take action instead. In such a situation, try not to worry. Nothing
can be gained from worrying about something that you have no control over.


# **Limiting the time you spend worrying**

Anxious people tend to spend much of their time worrying. Sometimes they worry to the point
that they find it very hard to 'switch off' and relax. Indeed, one of the most frustrating things
about feeling anxious is the seemingly uncontrollable worry that often occurs alongside it.
Therefore, if we can reduce the amount of time we spend worrying, we can reduce our anxiety
levels.


One way you can do this is to assign 'worry time'. This involves setting aside between fifteen
and twenty minutes each day that you will allow yourself to worry. Any worries that pop into your
head outside of 'worry time' should simply be noted and forgot about until later that day when
you try to resolve them during your 'worry time'. By noting them down, you can feel safe in the
knowledge that you won't forget about attempting to resolve them later on. This should free up
time during the day that is normally wasted worrying. Then - when your 'worry time' arrives, you
should allow yourself to think about the things that have been worrying you that day and try to
resolve them. 'Worry time' not only helps to reduce the time you spend worrying, but also
proves that you can have more control of whether you engage in worry or not. It also shows that
worry is often unnecessary. This is because when you come back to consider your problems
with a 'fresh eye', many of them have often resolved themselves or simply seem less important.


See the steps below for more details:


1. Decide a time in the day that you will have your 'worry time'.
2. At other times, simply note down any worries that pop into your head and try to
forget about them.
3. Once your 'worry time' arrives, choose how long you will allow yourself to 'worry' (try
to keep it no longer than 15-20 minutes). Begin timing yourself so your 'worry time'
doesn't overrun.
4. During worry time, try to resolve your worries proactively. Simply try to come up with
solutions to your worries if possible. Using a pen and pad to jot down solutions can
be helpful.
5. Stop as soon as your 'worry time' is finished. If any worries still feel unresolved,
simply carry them over to tomorrow's 'worry time'.


Here are some handy hints to help you with your 'worry time'.


    - If you find it difficult to switch off from all of your worries during the day, don't fret, as
this should improve with time and practice.

    - It may be useful to use the problem solving section in this guide during 'worry time'.

    - When it comes to 'worry time', feel free to cut it short if you have resolved all of your
worries early.

    - Often things that have worried us at one point in the day seem less problematic
when we re-visit them during 'worry time'. If this happens “great” simply forget about
them.

    - Remember, it is usually not possible to resolve every single worry or problem that
you have. So if something is outside your control (or has already happened), try not
to worry as you have done all you can. There is also the possibility that your worry
won't even come true in the first place.


# **Relaxation**

It is important to make time to relax and do activities that are enjoyable. This can help to reduce
your anxiety levels by calming the body and mind. It can also help you to sleep. Without taking
the time to unwind, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and stressed.


Relaxation can involve doing something that you enjoy, or just being by yourself. Good
examples might be reading a book or having a bath. Exercise is also particularly effective at
helping us to relax. What you do does not really matter. Try to choose something that you will
look forward to and that gives you a break. Doing an activity that you enjoy will also give you
less time to spend worrying. Here is a list of activities that might help you to relax.


Suggestions:


  - Do some exercise (e.g. swim, cycle)

  - Read a book

  - Watch your favourite TV show

  - Go to the cinema

  - Do something creative (e.g. draw, paint)

  - Visit a friend or family member

  - Have a bath


Try to add some of your own ideas into the box below. You will know what works best for you.


Try to find time to relax every day. This might seem difficult, but it is worth making time for. It
can help you to feel a lot better. There are audio relaxation guides available that you might find
a helpful support.


There are also some exercises described in the next few pages. They are specifically designed
to help you to relax. However, you should stop the exercise if at any time you begin to
experience discomfort or pain.


**Controlled breathing**

This simple technique involves focusing on and slowing down our breathing patterns. Many
people find this simple exercise very relaxing. It can be particularly helpful for those who feel
dizzy or light headed when they feel worried or stressed. This sometimes happens because
people's breathing changes and gets quicker when they feel distressed.


This can be an uncomfortable and unpleasant experience.
It can make people even more on edge, and a vicious cycle
can occur. Learning controlled breathing exercises can help
you to manage these feelings more effectively. It can also
help to give your mind and body a chance to calm down.


Remember, you can use this exercise to help you relax at
any time. You could even use it to help you get off to sleep.
However, it is particularly useful if you ever feel lightheaded, dizzy or faint.


**Beginning**

Get into a comfortable position.


**Middle**


Work out a stable breathing rhythm. Perhaps try to breathe in for three seconds, hold
this breathe for two seconds, and then breathe out for three seconds. It can be helpful
to count as you do this

e.g. **IN: 1 - 2 - 3, HOLD: 1 - 2, OUT: 1 - 2 - 3, HOLD: 1 - 2.**


**Ending**

Repeat this action for a few minutes. You should soon begin to feel more relaxed. If
you were feeling dizzy then this should also get better after a few minutes.


**Muscular relaxation**

Tension often builds up when we feel upset or stressed. These symptoms can be painful and
can cause anxiety in themselves. Muscular relaxation exercises can help you to control such
unpleasant symptoms. They can reduce physical tension and help you to relax in general.


During this exercise you have to tense and then relax different muscles in your body. You
should focus on the feelings that you experience whilst doing this. With practice you will then be
more able to recognise and respond to the onset of tension.


You can work through as many muscle groups as you like. Don't feel that you have to cover
every muscle in your whole body. It can be helpful to stick to the same muscle groups each time
you practice. That way you can get into a routine which you can easily remember. If you
practice this nearly every day you will probably notice an improvement after a couple of weeks.


**Beginning**

Find somewhere comfortable and quiet where you won't be interrupted. You can
either sit or lie down to practice this exercise. Begin by focusing on your breathing. Try
to have a slow and comfortable pace. You could use the controlled breathing technique
described earlier. Do this for a few minutes to prepare for the muscular relaxation
exercise.


**Middle**

Try to tense each muscle group for around five seconds. Don't tense the muscle too

tight. Focus on the sensations that this brings. Then relax your muscles for a similar
length of time, and again, focus on how this feels. Then move onto the next muscle
group. Try to remember to keep your breathing at a comfortable pace throughout.

Below are some suggestions of muscle groups that you may wish to work through:


      - **Legs**       - point your toes and tense your muscles as if you were trying to stand up.

      - **Stomach**       - tense your stomach muscles.

      - **Arms**       - make fists and tense your muscles as if you were trying to lift something.

      - **Shoulders**       - shrug your shoulders. Lift them up towards your ears.

      - **Face**       - make a frowning expression. Squeeze your eyes shut and screw up your
nose. Clench your teeth.


**Ending**

It can be helpful to spend a few minutes just lying quietly in a relaxed state. See if you
can notice any tension in your body and try to relax it. Otherwise, just let the tension
be. If your mind wanders, try to bring your concentration back to your breathing.

Finally, count down silently and slowly: **5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0,** and come out of the
relaxation in your own time. See if it's possible to carry that relaxed feeling into
whatever you do next.


**Distraction**

Distraction is a good technique to fend off symptoms of anxiety and stress when they feel
overwhelming. This can also give you space to deal with a situation in a more considered
and positive manner. It is also helpful when you don't have the space or time to use a more
proactive approach, such as a relaxation exercise.


Distraction simply involves trying to take your mind off uncomfortable symptoms or thoughts.
You can do this by trying to focus on something unrelated. Often this helps them to pass. It is
still important to remember that the symptoms of anxiety are not harmful or dangerous. Even if
you didn't use distraction or relaxation techniques, nothing terrible would happen.


Ideas to help distract you from your troubling thoughts or anxiety include:


  - Try to appreciate small details in your surroundings.

  - Count backwards from 1000 in multiples of 7.

  - Focus on your breathing, for example, how it feels to breathe in and out.

  - Count things that you can see that begin with a particular letter.

  - Visualise being in a pleasant, safe and comfortable environment (e.g. being on a beach).

  - Listen to your favourite music. Try to pick out all the different instruments and sounds
that you can hear.


As with any relaxation exercise, it may take a few minutes before you begin to feel like it is

# **Reducing avoidance**

People often get into the habit of avoiding situations that cause them difficulty. This coping
strategy can unfortunately make the problem worse. This is because the longer we avoid
something, the more intimidating it becomes. By avoiding situations we also stop ourselves
from proving that we can cope in them. As a result our anxiety towards the situation continues
and our confidence remains low.

Take the example below:


_Someone who tends to worry about being judged negatively by others_


    - _May avoid going out socially in case people don't like them or they make a fool_
_of themselves. For instance, they may avoid going to work nights out, parties,_
_restaurants, or taking part in a hobby._

    - _May avoid speaking when in large groups, instead staying quiet and not really_
_'being themselves'._

    - _May avoid all performance situations, such as giving a speech or showing off_
_a piece of work, due to their fear of being negatively evaluated._


_By avoiding all of these related situations, they never have a chance to practice in them_
_or prove that they could cope well._


It is easy to see how using avoidance as a strategy to cope can soon begin to have a negative
impact on people's lives as they start to avoid more and more situations. If instead we confront
difficult situations then it is possible to build up our confidence. This will help your anxiety to
reduce significantly.


**List the things that you avoid**


Come up with a list of the situations that you often try to escape from or avoid. Use box
1 on page 28 to create your list.

For example:


**Ranking these situations**


Rank your list of situations in order of difficulty. From the least anxiety provoking to the

most anxiety provoking on a scale of 0 -100. 0 = no anxiety and 100 = extreme anxiety.
Use box 2 (page 28).

For example:


Once you have done this, try to organise your items from least anxiety provoking to
most anxiety provoking. You can use box 3 on page 28 to do this.


**Confronting the lowest ranked situation**


Try to confront the lowest ranked item on your list. This will be the item that causes you
least anxiety. You will likely find that although your anxiety might initially rise, it will drop
if you remain in the situation for long enough. Try to stay with the situation until your
anxiety has reduced by at least half.


**Repeating this task**

Repeat the task as often as possible (every day if you can). Try not to leave too long
between times when you confront this item. This is because the more you confront
something, the more your fear will reduce. You should notice your anxiety getting less
and less each time you do so. You may find eventually that it will cause you little or no
anxiety at all.


**Moving on to the next lowest item**

When you feel comfortable with an item, try to move on to the next item on your list.
Working through your list you will begin to feel anxious in fewer and fewer situations.
You should find that your confidence grows as you move on from each item. You
should find that tasks ranked as more difficult seem more manageable as you progress.

Things to consider:


  - Don't fear the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety is a
natural and healthy reaction that is not
dangerous.

  -  Try not to escape situations you fear half-way
through. Stay, and your anxiety will eventually
decrease.

  - Your anxiety will reduce each time you confront a
feared situation. Try to confront your fears as
often as possible.

  - You may also find it helpful to challenge any
unhelpful thoughts as you face a fear.

  - Look out for other situations that you avoid due
to anxiety. Try to gradually reduce your
avoidance more and more.

  - You may confront an item on your list which
doesn't go as well as you had hoped. Try not to
give up. Persevere, and it should eventually get
easier.

  - If an item on your list seems too hard, see if you
can put in an extra step or two before it. This will
allow your confidence to rise further before you
face it.
