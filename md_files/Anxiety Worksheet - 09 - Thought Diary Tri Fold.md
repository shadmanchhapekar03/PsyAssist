**OBJECTIVE:**
This Thought Diary aims to help you
understand the difference between thoughts
and feelings.


**INSTRUCTIONS:**


**Begin with section A:**
Write about an event or situation in which you
felt distressed or upset. Record the situation in
the same way that a video camera might record
it – simply the facts.


**Then go to section C:**
Write down the words that best describe your
feelings. Choose one that best describes how
you feel in this situation. Underline this word &
rate the intensity of the emotion from 0 to 100.
When you have finished, also write down any
actions you may have carried out.


**Now look at the situation in A and**
**complete section B:**
List all the thoughts, beliefs, values, attitudes, and
expectations you had about “A” that caused the
feelings and actions in “C.” Use the automatic
thought discovery questions available. Find the
“Hot thought”, the thought that best relates to
the emotion you underlined in “C”. Rate how
much you believe this statement on a scale from
0 to 100.
